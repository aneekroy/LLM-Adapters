Therefore, 22% of the revenue came from the sale of biographies. To find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies, we need to divide the revenue from the sale of novels by the revenue from the sale of biographies. The revenue from the sale of novels is 34% or 0.34, and the revenue from the sale of biographies is 22% or 0.22. Therefore, the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies is 0.34 / 0.22 = 1.55, which is approximately 1.5. Therefore, the revenue from the sale",

The time it takes for the ship and the plane to meet can be found by dividing the distance the ship has traveled by the relative speed between the ship and the plane.

Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, the amount each daughter receives will be 4x.

The total number of sons is 5, the total number of daughters is 4, and the total number of nephews is 2. The total amount to be divided is Rs 8600. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600. This simplifies to 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600, which further simplifies to 43x = 8600. Solving for x, we get x = 200.

Since the train takes 10 hours to reach its destination at a speed of 100 miles/hour, the total distance can be found by multiplying the speed by the time: 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles. The train covers a quarter of this distance before slowing down, which is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles. The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. At the reduced speed of 75 miles/hour, the time it takes to cover the remaining 750 miles is 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours.

When working together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates: (1/40 + 1/45) of the wall per minute. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 180. So, the combined rate of work is (4.5/180 + 4/180) = 8.5/180 of the wall per minute. To find the time it takes to complete the wall, we can divide 1 (the whole wall) by the combined rate of work: 1 / (8.5/180) = 180/8.5 = 21.18 minutes.

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, and Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so their combined speed is 10 + 20 = 30 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take for them to collectively bike 1 mile, we need to divide 1 mile by their combined speed of 30 miles per hour. 1 mile / 30 miles per hour = 1/30 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1/30 hour to minutes by multiplying 1/30 by 60. 1/30 * 60 = 2 minutes.

This means that the total deer population in the forest is 100/4 = 25 times the number of deer with tags.

Since 20 out of 500 deer in the sample had tags, the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is 20/500 = 0.04. This proportion is assumed to be representative of the proportion of the total deer population that had tags in 2002. Since 300 deer were tagged in 2001, the proportion of the total deer population that had tags in 2002 is 300/(total deer population) = 0.04. Solving for the total deer population, we have 300/(total deer population) = 0.04, so total deer population = 300/0.04 = 7500. Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.
