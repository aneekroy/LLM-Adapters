Simplifying the equation, we get x + 2 - y = x - y + 19. Subtracting x from both sides, we get 2 - y = -y + 19. Adding y to both sides, we get 2 = -y + 19. Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get -17 = -y. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get y = 17. Therefore, Doug lost 17 marbles.<|eot_id|>",

Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up an equation. Let x be the number of cups of flour she has already put in. Then, the number of cups of flour she still needs is 6 - x. Since she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up the equation 6 - x = 13 + 8. Solving for x, we get 6 - x = 21. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get -x = 15. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = -15. Since we can't have a negative number of cups of flour, this means that Mary has already put in 0 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups of flour she has already put in from the total number of cups of flour the recipe calls for: 6 - 0 = 6.

This is because the number of crayons he had left is the result of subtracting the number of crayons he lost or gave away from the total number of crayons he originally had.\n\n                 Let x be the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday. We know that x - 551 = 177. To solve for x, we need to add 551 to both sides of the equation. This gives us x = 177 + 551. Solving for x, we get x = 728. Therefore, Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday.\n\n                 Alternatively, we can also solve this problem by adding the number of crayons he had left to the number of crayons he lost or gave away. This gives us x = 177 + 551 = 728. Therefore, Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday.<|eot_id|>",

Since each pack has 14 pencils and she has 6 packs, the total number of pencils in the packs is 14 * 6 = 84. Then, we need to add the number of pencils in the rows. Since each row has 22 pencils and she has 4 rows, the total number of pencils in the rows is 22 * 4 = 88. To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to add the number of pencils in the packs and the number of pencils in the rows. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is 84 + 88 = 172. The final answer is 172.<|eot_id|>",
