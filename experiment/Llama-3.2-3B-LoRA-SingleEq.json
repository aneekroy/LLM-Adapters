The problem states that 0.20 of the number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. We can write this as an equation: 0.20x - 4 = 6. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, we add 4 to both sides of the equation: 0.20x = 6 + 4. This simplifies to 0.20x = 10. Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20 to solve for x: x = 10 / 0.20.

The amount he spent on ice cream is 2 pennies, which is equal to 2 cents. The amount he spent on baseball cards is 12 dimes, which is equal to 12 x 10 cents, or 120 cents. Adding these two amounts together, we get 2 cents + 120 cents = 122 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 122 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. 122 cents \u00f7 100 = 1.22 dollars.
