The number of days it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted is equal to the number of days it takes for 8 puppies to be adopted divided by the number of days it takes for 1 puppy to be adopted. The number of days it takes for 8 puppies to be adopted is 8 days. The number of days it takes for 1 puppy to be adopted is 1 day.
