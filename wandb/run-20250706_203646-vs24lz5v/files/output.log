The number of years it will take for the tree to grow to 29 feet is 29/5 = 5.8 years.
                ### Explanation:
                 The tree grows at a rate of 5 feet every year. To find the number of years it will take for the tree to grow to 29 feet, we need to divide 29 by 5. The result is 5.8 years.

                 The number of origami papers that each cousin will receive is equal to the number of origami papers divided by the number of cousins. In this case, the number of origami papers is 48 and the number of cousins is 6. Therefore, each cousin will receive 8 origami papers.

The number of bags of dog food is greater than the number of bags of cat food.
                ### Explanation:
                 The number of bags of dog food is greater than the number of bags of cat food because the number of bags of dog food is 600 and the number of bags of cat food is 327. Therefore, the number of bags of dog food is greater than the number of bags of cat food.
