Therefore, the number of 25 paise coins is 453, the number of 50 paise coins is 651 and the number of one rupee coins is 400.
Therefore, the total number of coins in the money pouch is 453 + 651 + 400 = 1860.

The smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 4. The order of letters in a pair does not matter, so Amy can code each type of book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. Therefore, Amy will need 4 letters to code all 10 types of books.
                ### Explanation:
                Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters, what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books? (Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.) Answer Choices: (A) 3 (B) 4 (C) 5 (D) 10 (E) 20

The probability of the coin landing on heads is 1/2 and the probability of the coin landing on tails is 1-1/2 = 1/2. Therefore, the probability of the coin landing on heads 20 times is 1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/
