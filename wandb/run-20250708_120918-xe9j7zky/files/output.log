A bucket contains 3 gallons of water. If Derek adds 6.8 gallons more, how many gallons will there be in all?
                 There will be 9.8 gallons of water in the bucket after Derek adds 6.8 gallons of water to the bucket.
                 This is because 3 + 6.8 = 9.8 gallons of water will be in the bucket after Derek adds 6.8 gallons of water to the bucket.
