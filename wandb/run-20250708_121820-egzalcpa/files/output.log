John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
The final concentration of tea John drinks is 15.38%.
To calculate the final concentration of tea John drinks, we first need to calculate the concentration of tea in the original 50% strong milk tea. The concentration of tea in the original 50% strong milk tea is 50% - 15% = 35%.
Next, we need to calculate the concentration of tea in the resultant solution after replacing 15% of it with milk twice. The concentration of tea in the resultant solution after replacing 15% of it with milk twice is 35% - 15% = 20%.
Finally, we need to calculate the concentration of tea in the final solution after replacing 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk. The concentration of tea in the final solution

The maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile is 12.75 miles.
                 To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, we need to find the number of quarter miles that we can travel with $8.50. We can do this by dividing $8.50 by the cost of each quarter mile, which is $3.50 + 0.10 = $3.60. The number of quarter miles that we can travel with $8.50 is therefore 8.50 / 3.60 = 2.36. This means that we can travel 2.36 quarter miles with $8.50. The maximum distance that we can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile is therefore 2.36 x 0.25 = 0.59 miles. This means that we can travel 0.59 miles with $8.50 on a cab which

                 The number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F of a regular pentagon ABCDE with F at its center is 10. This is because there are 10 different ways to choose 4 of the 5 points A, B, C, D, E, and F to form a quadrilateral. For example, one way to form a quadrilateral is to choose points A, B, C, and D. Another way to form a quadrilateral is to choose points A, B, C, and E. There are 10 different ways to choose 4 of the 5 points to form a quadrilateral, so the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F of a regular pentagon ABCDE with F at its
