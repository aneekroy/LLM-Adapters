A bucket contains 3 gallons of water. If Derek adds 6.8 gallons more, how many gallons will there be in all?
                 There will be 9.8 gallons of water in the bucket after Derek adds 6.8 gallons of water to the bucket.
                 This is because 3 + 6.8 = 9.8 gallons of water will be in the bucket after Derek adds 6.8 gallons of water to the bucket.

The question asks how many gallons of oil leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe. To answer this question, we need to subtract the amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe from the total amount of oil that leaked before the pipe was fixed. The total amount of oil that leaked before the pipe was fixed is 6206 gallons. The amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe is 6206 - 2475 = 3731 gallons. Therefore, the amount of oil that leaked while the engineers were fixing the pipe is 3731 gallons.<|end_of_text|>

The number of coats collected at the elementary schools is 2515. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of coats collected at the high schools (6922) from the total number of coats collected (9437).
                 9437 - 6922 = 2515
                 Therefore, the number of coats collected at the elementary schools is 2515.

                 Craig walked 0.2 mile from school to David's house and 0.7 mile from David's house to his own house.

It rained 0.2 inches on Tuesday.
                ### Explanation:
                The question asks how much it rained on Tuesday. To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the amount of rain that fell on Monday and the amount of rain that fell on Tuesday. We know that it rained 0.9 inches on Monday and 0.7 inches less than that on Tuesday. Therefore, the amount of rain that fell on Tuesday was 0.9 inches minus 0.7 inches, or 0.2 inches.<|end_of_text|>

The treasure hunter discovered a buried treasure chest filled with a total of 5155 gems. 45 of the gems were diamonds, and the rest were rubies. How many of the gems were rubies?
                 The number of rubies in the treasure chest can be calculated by subtracting the number of diamonds from the total number of gems.
                 5155 - 45 = 5110
                 Therefore, there were 5110 rubies in the treasure chest.

The fraction of the students in the band that are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section is 0.625. This is because 0.5 of the students in the band are in the trumpet section and 0.125 of the students in the band are in the trombone section. Therefore, 0.5 + 0.125 = 0.625 of the students in the band are in either the trumpet section or the trombone section.
