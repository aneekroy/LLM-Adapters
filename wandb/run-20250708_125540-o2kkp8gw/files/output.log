There were 56 puppies in the pet store. In one day they sold 24 of them and put the rest into cages with 4 in each cage. This means that there were 56 - 24 = 32 puppies left in the pet store. To find out how many cages they used, we need to divide the number of puppies by the number of puppies in each cage. 32 ÷ 4 = 8 cages. Therefore, there were 8 cages in the pet store.

There will be 2 groups with 5 players in each group.
                ### Explanation:
                 The number of groups can be found by dividing the total number of players by the number of players in each group. Since there are 4 new players and 6 returning players, the total number of players is 10. Since there are 5 players in each group, the number of groups can be found by dividing 10 by 5. 10 divided by 5 is 2, so there will be 2 groups with 5 players in each group.

Sam invited 9 friends to a birthday party, but 6 couldn't come. If he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 2, how many should he buy?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cupcakes that Sam needs to buy so that each person can have exactly 2 cupcakes.
                 We know that Sam invited 9 friends to the party, but 6 of them couldn't come. This means that there are 3 friends who will attend the party.
                 We also know that each person should have exactly 2 cupcakes.
                 To find the number of cupcakes that Sam needs to buy, we need to multiply the number of friends who will attend the party (3) by the number of cupcakes that each person should have (2).
                 3 x 2 = 6
                 Therefore, Sam needs to buy 6 cupcakes so that each person can have exactly 2 cupcakes.

                 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Maria was making baggies of cookies with 5 cookies in each bag. If she had 33 chocolate chip cookies and 2 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
                 The number of baggies that Maria could make is equal to the total number of cookies divided by the number of cookies in each bag. In this case, the total number of cookies is 33 + 2 = 35, and the number of cookies in each bag is 5. Therefore, the number of baggies that Maria could make is equal to 35 ÷ 5 = 7.
                 Another way to solve this problem is to use the formula for the number of baggies, which is equal to the total number of cookies divided by the number of cookies in each bag. In this case, the total number of cookies is 33 + 2 = 35, and the number of cookies in each bag is 5. Therefore, the number of baggies that Maria could make is equal to 35 ÷ 5 = 7.
                 In conclusion, the number of baggies that Maria could make is equal to the total number of cookies divided by the number of cookies in each bag. In this case, the total number of cookies is

A trivia team had 9 members total, but during a game 3 members didn't show up. If each member that did show up scored 2 points, how many points were scored total?
                 The total number of points scored by the trivia team is 18. This is because each member that did show up scored 2 points, and there were 6 members that did show up. Therefore, the total number of points scored by the trivia team is 2 x 6 = 12.
                 To calculate the total number of points scored by the trivia team, we need to multiply the number of points scored by each member that did show up by the number of members that did show up. In this case, there were 6 members that did show up, so the total number of points scored by the trivia team is 2 x 6 = 12.
                 Another way to calculate the total number of points scored by the trivia team is to add up the number of points scored by each member that did show up. In this case, there were 6 members that did show up, so the total number of points scored by the trivia team is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 =

                 The number of pieces of clothing that could go in each of the small loads is 9. This is because 47 divided by 5 is 9 with a remainder of 2. Therefore, the number of pieces of clothing that could go in each of the small loads is 9.

                 There are 9 bird cages in the pet store. Each cage has 2 parrots and 2 parakeets in it.
                 The total number of birds in the pet store is 9 x 2 parrots + 9 x 2 parakeets.
                 9 x 2 parrots = 18 parrots
                 9 x 2 parakeets = 18 parakeets
                 The total number of birds in the pet store is 18 parrots + 18 parakeets.
                 18 parrots + 18 parakeets = 36 birds

If a teacher had 16 worksheets to grade and had already graded 8 of them, how many more problems does she have to grade?
                 The teacher has 16 worksheets to grade and has already graded 8 of them. This means that the teacher has 8 worksheets left to grade.
                 To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to subtract the number of problems the teacher has already graded from the total number of problems on the worksheets.
                 16 - 8 = 8. This means that the teacher has 8 more problems to grade.
                 Therefore, the teacher has 16 worksheets to grade and has already graded 8 of them. This means that the teacher has 8 worksheets left to grade.

A magician was selling magic card decks for 7 dollars each. If he started with 16 decks and by the end of the day he had 8 left, how much money did he earn?
                 The magician started with 16 decks and by the end of the day he had 8 decks left. This means that he sold 8 decks during the day.
                 The price of each deck is 7 dollars, so the total amount of money he earned is 8 x 7 = 56 dollars.
                 Therefore, the magician earned a total of 56 dollars by selling 8 decks during the day.
                 Note that this is just one possible solution to the problem. There may be other ways to solve it, depending on the specific details of the situation.
                 For example, if the magician started with a different number of decks, or if the price of each deck was different, the solution might be different.
                 However, the basic idea of the problem remains the same: the magician started with a certain number of decks and by the end of the day he had a different number of decks left.
                 The amount of money he earned can be calculated by multiplying the number of decks he sold by the price of each deck

                 The teacher has 17 worksheets to grade and has already graded 8 of them. This means that the teacher has 9 worksheets left to grade. To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to subtract the number of problems already graded from the total number of problems on the worksheets.
                 9 - 8 = 1
                 Therefore, the teacher has 1 more problem to grade on each of the 9 worksheets she has left to grade, for a total of 9 x 1 = 9 more problems to grade.

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 7 points. If a level has 11 enemies total and you destroy all but 8 of them, how many points would you earn?
                 The answer to this question is 49 points. This is because there are 11 enemies in the level and you destroyed all but 8 of them. Therefore, you would earn 7 points for each enemy that you destroyed. However, you only destroyed 3 enemies, so you would earn 3 times 7 points, which is 21 points. However, you also destroyed 8 enemies, so you would earn 8 times 7 points, which is 56 points. Therefore, the total number of points that you would earn is 21 + 56, which is 77 points. Therefore, the answer to this question is 77 points.<|end_of_text|>

                 There are 10 pictures in the first coloring book and 39 pictures in the second coloring book. After one week, Gwen has colored 13 pictures in total.
                 To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we need to subtract the number of pictures she has already colored from the total number of pictures in both coloring books.
                 10 + 39 - 13 = 34
                 Therefore, Gwen still has to color 34 pictures in total.

                 Since each van can hold 4 people, we need to divide 8 by 4 to find out how many vans will be needed.
                 8 ÷ 4 = 2.

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 8 points. If a level has 7 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?
                 The answer to this question is 56 points. This is because there are 7 enemies in the level, and each enemy defeated gives you 8 points. If you destroy all but 2 of the enemies, then you would have destroyed 5 enemies. Therefore, you would have earned 5 x 8 = 40 points. However, there are still 2 enemies left in the level, so you would also earn 2 x 8 = 16 points. Therefore, the total number of points you would earn is 40 + 16 = 56 points.
                 I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<|end_of_text|>

April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 3 dollars. If Robin bought 5 roses and 4 daisies, how much did she spend?

                 The price of each rose is 3 dollars, so the total cost of the roses is 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.
                 The price of each daisy is 3 dollars, so the total cost of the daisies is 3 x 4 = 12 dollars.
                 The total cost of all the flowers is 15 + 12 = 27 dollars.

The total number of points scored by the trivia team is 45. This is because each member that did show up scored 3 points, and there were 9 members that did show up. Therefore, the total number of points scored by the trivia team is 9 x 3 = 27. Since there were 6 members that didn't show up, the total number of points scored by the trivia team is 27 + 6 x 3 = 27 + 18 = 45.<|end_of_text|>

Roger had 120 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?
                 The total number of pieces of clothing that Roger had to wash was 120. He put 48 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 9 equal loads. This means that the number of pieces of clothing that could go in each of the small loads is 120 divided by 9, which is 13.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333

Robin was making baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag. If she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies, how many baggies could she make?
                 The number of baggies that Robin could make is equal to the total number of cookies divided by the number of cookies in each bag. In this case, the total number of cookies is 23 + 25 = 48, and the number of cookies in each bag is 6. Therefore, the number of baggies that Robin could make is 48 ÷ 6 = 8.
                 Another way to solve this problem is to use the formula for the number of baggies, which is equal to the total number of cookies divided by the number of cookies in each bag. In this case, the total number of cookies is 23 + 25 = 48, and the number of cookies in each bag is 6. Therefore, the number of baggies that Robin could make is 48 ÷ 6 = 8.
                 In conclusion, Robin could make 8 baggies of cookies with 6 cookies in each bag if she had 23 chocolate chip cookies and 25 oatmeal cookies.<|end_of_text|>

Billy was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page. If he had 3 new cards and 42 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
                 The number of pages Billy would use to organize his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page is 9.
                 To calculate the number of pages Billy would use to organize his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page, we need to divide the total number of cards by the number of cards on each page.
                 The total number of cards is the sum of the number of new cards and the number of old cards.
                 The number of new cards is 3.
                 The number of old cards is 42.
                 The total number of cards is 3 + 42 = 45.
                 The number of cards on each page is 5.
                 The number of pages Billy would use to organize his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page is 45 ÷ 5 = 9.
                 Therefore, the number of pages Billy would use to organize his baseball cards in a binder with 5 on each page is 9.

April's discount flowers was having a sale where each flower was 6 dollars. If Maria bought 7 roses and 3 daisies, how much did she spend?
                 Maria bought 7 roses and 3 daisies, so the total number of flowers is 7 + 3 = 10.
                 The price of each rose is 6 dollars, and the price of each daisy is 6 dollars.
                 The total cost of the 10 flowers is 6 x 7 + 6 x 3 = 42 + 18 = 60 dollars.
                 Therefore, Maria spent a total of 60 dollars on the 10 flowers.

Emily was planting vegetables in her garden. She started with 41 seeds and planted 29 of them in the big garden and in each of her small gardens put 4 seeds each. How many small gardens did Emily have?
                 There are 29 seeds in the big garden and 4 seeds in each of the small gardens. Therefore, the total number of seeds in the small gardens is 29 x 4 = 116 seeds.
                 To find the number of small gardens, we need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds in each small garden.
                 116 ÷ 4 = 29 small gardens.
                 Therefore, Emily had 29 small gardens.

It would take 7 days for all of the puppies to be adopted. This is because there are 40 puppies in total and 8 puppies are adopted each day. Therefore, it would take 5 days for 40-8=32 puppies to be adopted. Then, it would take 1 more day for the remaining 8 puppies to be adopted. Therefore, it would take 7 days for all of the puppies to be adopted.<|end_of_text|>

Edward was working as a sacker at a grocery store where he made 6 dollars an hour. On Monday he worked 3 hours and on Tuesday he worked 5 hours. How much money did Edward make in those two days?
                 The total amount of money Edward made in those two days was 30 dollars. This is because 3 hours at 6 dollars an hour is 18 dollars and 5 hours at 6 dollars an hour is 30 dollars. Therefore, the total amount of money Edward made in those two days was 18 dollars plus 30 dollars, which is 30 dollars.

It would take 9 days for all of the puppies to be adopted. This is because there are 36 puppies in total, and 4 puppies are adopted each day. Therefore, it would take 9 days for all of the puppies to be adopted.
                ### Explanation:
                 To solve this problem, we can use the formula for finding the number of days it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted. The formula is: number of days = total number of puppies / number of puppies adopted each day. In this case, the total number of puppies is 36, and the number of puppies adopted each day is 4. Therefore, the number of days it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted is: 36 / 4 = 9. This means that it would take 9 days for all of the puppies to be adopted.
                 Another way to solve this problem is to use the formula for finding the number of days it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted. The formula is: number of days = total number of puppies / number of puppies adopted each day. In this case, the total number of puppies is 36, and the number of puppies adopted each day is 4.

                 There are a total of 7 boxes of chocolate candy. Will gave 3 boxes to his little brother, leaving him with 4 boxes. Each box has 4 pieces inside it, so there are a total of 4 * 4 = 16 pieces in the 4 boxes that Will kept for himself. Therefore, Will still had 16 pieces of chocolate candy after giving 3 boxes to his little brother.

The cafeteria had 50 apples. For lunch they handed out 5 to students and decided to use the rest to make pies. If each pie takes 5 apples, how many pies could they make?
                 The number of pies that could be made is 10. This is because 50-5=45 and 45 divided by 5 is 9 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 10 pies could be made.

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 5 points. If a level has 8 enemies total and you destroy all but 6 of them, how many points would you earn?
                 The answer to this question is 30 points. This is because there are 8 enemies in the level, and you destroyed all but 6 of them. Therefore, you would earn 5 points for each of the 2 enemies that you did not destroy, for a total of 10 points. Additionally, you would earn 5 points for each of the 6 enemies that you did destroy, for a total of 30 points. Therefore, the total number of points that you would earn is 10 + 30 = 40 points.<|end_of_text|>

Will was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of cards that Will needs to put in the binder. We can do this by adding the number of new cards (8) and the number of old cards (10). This gives us a total of 18 cards that Will needs to put in the binder.
                 Next, we need to find the number of pages that Will needs to use. We can do this by dividing the total number of cards (18) by the number of cards on each page (3). This gives us a total of 6 pages that Will needs to use.
                 Finally, we need to round up the number of pages to the nearest whole number. This gives us a total of 7 pages that Will needs to use.
                 In conclusion, Will needs to use 7 pages to organize his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page. If he had 8 new cards and 10 old cards to put in the binder, how many pages would he use? The answer is 7

In a video game, each enemy defeated gives you 3 points. If a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them, how many points would you earn?
                 The answer to this question is 15 points. This is because there are 6 enemies in the level, and you destroyed all but 2 of them. Therefore, you would earn 3 points for each of the 4 enemies that you destroyed, for a total of 12 points. However, you would also earn 3 points for each of the 2 enemies that you did not destroy, for a total of 3 more points. Therefore, the total number of points that you would earn is 12 + 3 = 15 points.
                 I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.<|end_of_text|>

                 The price of each rose is 3 dollars, so the total cost of the roses is 3 x 8 = 24 dollars.
                 The price of each daisy is 3 dollars, so the total cost of the daisies is 3 x 2 = 6 dollars.
                 The total cost of all the flowers is 24 + 6 = 30 dollars.
                 Therefore, Zoe spent 30 dollars on the flowers.

                 The total cost for the group to eat would be $30. This is because there are 15 people in the group and 9 of them are kids. Each adult meal costs $2 and kids eat free. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat would be $2 x 6 + $0 x 9 = $12 + $0 = $12. This means that the total cost for the group to eat would be $12 + $18 = $30.<|end_of_text|>
