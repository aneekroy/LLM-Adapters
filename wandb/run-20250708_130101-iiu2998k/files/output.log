John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening. In a 50% strong milk tea, he replaces 15% of it with milk twice. Then, he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk.
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks? Answer Choices: (A) 15.38% (B) 42% (C) 39.86% (D) 22.35% (E) 32.51%
The final concentration of tea John drinks is 15.38%.
To calculate the final concentration of tea John drinks, we first need to calculate the concentration of tea in the original 50% strong milk tea. The concentration of tea in the original 50% strong milk tea is 50% - 15% = 35%.
Next, we need to calculate the concentration of tea in the resultant solution after replacing 15% of it with milk twice. The concentration of tea in the resultant solution after replacing 15% of it with milk twice is 35% - 15% = 20%.
Finally, we need to calculate the concentration of tea in the final solution after replacing 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk. The concentration of tea in the final solution

The maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile is 12.75 miles.
                 To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, we need to find the number of quarter miles that we can travel with $8.50. We can do this by dividing $8.50 by the cost of each quarter mile, which is $3.50 + 0.10 = $3.60. The number of quarter miles that we can travel with $8.50 is therefore 8.50 / 3.60 = 2.36. This means that we can travel 2.36 quarter miles with $8.50. The maximum distance that we can travel with $8.50 on a cab which charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile is therefore 2.36 x 0.25 = 0.59 miles. This means that we can travel 0.59 miles with $8.50 on a cab which

A man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hrs and at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. His average speed is Answer Choices: (A) 4 1/3 km/h (B) 7 2/3 km/h (C) 9 ½ km/h (D) 8 km/h (E) 81 km/h
                 The average speed is the total distance travelled divided by the total time taken.
                 Distance travelled at 5 kmph for 6 hrs = 5 * 6 = 30 km
                 Distance travelled at 4 kmph for 12 hrs = 4 * 12 = 48 km
                 Total distance travelled = 30 + 48 = 78 km
                 Total time taken = 6 + 12 = 18 hrs
                 Average speed = 78 / 18 = 4 1/3 km/h

                 The question asks how much will B bottles of soda cost in dollars if 27 bottles of soda cost A cents. The answer choices are (A) AB/2700, (B) 27/AB, (C) AB/270, (D) 2700/AB, and (E) 100AB/27. The question is asking for the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars, so the correct answer is (B) 27/AB. This is because if 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, then 1 bottle of soda costs A/27 cents. Therefore, if B bottles of soda cost A/27 cents each, then B bottles of soda will cost AB/27 cents, which is the same as 27/AB dollars.
                 Another way to think about this is that if 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, then 1 bottle of soda costs A/27 cents. Therefore, if B bottles of

                The trader sold an article at a profit of 20% for Rs.360. To find the cost price of the article, we need to use the formula for profit and loss. The formula for profit and loss is: Profit = SP - CP, where SP is the selling price and CP is the cost price. In this case, the selling price is Rs.360 and the profit is 20%. Therefore, the cost price of the article is: CP = SP - Profit = 360 - (0.20 x 360) = 360 - 72 = 288. Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.288.<|end_of_text|>

A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday? Answer Choices: (A) 15 (B) 30 (C) 45 (D) 60 (E) 75
                 The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers. This means that the hotel orders 2 papers on Sunday and 1 paper on the rest of the days of the week. The total number of papers ordered by the hotel is 2 + 1 = 3.
                 The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers. This means that the hotel pays $210/3 = $70 for each paper ordered. Since the hotel orders 3 papers per week, the total cost of the papers ordered by the hotel is $70 x 3 = $210.
                 The hotel orders 2 papers on Sunday and 1 paper on the rest of the days of the week. This means that the hotel orders 2 + 1 =

A bookshelf contains 45 books, 30 of which are hardcover and 20 of which are fiction. What is the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction? Answer Choices: (A) 10 (B) 15 (C) 18 (D) 20 (E) 30
                 The maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 18. This is because there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, so the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction is 30 + 20 - 2 = 18.
                 To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we need to find the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction. We can do this by subtracting the number of books that are not both hardcover and fiction from the total number of books.
                 The number of books that are not both hardcover and fiction is 45 - 30 - 20 = 15. This is because there are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books, so the number of books that are not both hardcover and fiction is 45 - 30 - 20 = 15.

64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work. During their membership drive, the same number of boys and girls joined the group. How many members does the group have now, if the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3? Answer Choices: (A) 277 (B) 288 (C) 200 (D) 277 (E) 168
                 The ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, which means that there are 4 boys for every 3 girls. This means that there are 4 times as many boys as there are girls in the group.
                 To find the total number of members in the group, we need to multiply the number of boys by 4 and the number of girls by 3. This gives us a total of 64 × 4 + 40 × 3 = 288 members in the group.
                 Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 288.

If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m? Answer Choices: (A) -23.5 (B) -17.5 (C) -10.5 (D) -16.2 (E) Cannot be determined
                 The quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 has a root of 1.5, which means that 1.5 is a solution to the equation. To find the value of m, we can substitute 1.5 for x in the equation and solve for m.
                 x^2 + mx + 22 = 0
                 1.5^2 + m(1.5) + 22 = 0
                 2.25 + m(1.5) + 22 = 0
                 2.25 + 1.5m + 22 = 0
                 1.5m + 23.75 = 0
                 1.5m = -23.75
                 m = -15.92
                 Therefore, the value of m is -15.92.<|end_of_text|>

The minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 3. This is because the cost of the membership is $7.00 per month, and the cost of renting a DVD without a membership is $4.00 per movie. If you rent 3 movies without a membership, the total cost would be $12.00, which is less than the cost of the membership. However, if you rent 4 movies without a membership, the total cost would be $16.00, which is more than the cost of the membership. Therefore, the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 3.

The question asks how many minutes it would take for two friends to finish a jar of candies if they were to eat them simultaneously. It is given that had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar, and had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. The question then asks how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar.
                 In order to answer this question, we need to determine how long it would take for both P and Q to finish the jar of candies if they were to eat them simultaneously. We can do this by first determining how long it would take for P to finish the jar of candies if he were to eat them alone. Since it would take him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar, we can conclude that it would take him 20 minutes to finish half the jar. Similarly, since it would take Q 5 minutes to finish half the jar, we can conclude that it would take her 10 minutes to finish the jar of candies if she were to eat them alone.
                 Now that we know how long it would take for both P and Q to finish the jar of candies if they were to eat them alone,

                 The percentage gain of a merchant who purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450 and sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg can be calculated using the following formula:
                 Percentage Gain = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price x 100
                 Substituting the given values, we get:
                 Percentage Gain = (7.50 - 450) / 450 x 100
                 Percentage Gain = (7.50 - 450) / 450 x 100
                 Percentage Gain = (7.50 - 450) / 450 x 100
                 Percentage Gain = (7.50 - 450) / 450 x 100
                 Percentage Gain = (7.50 - 450) / 450 x 100

When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Find the area of the sheet. Answer Choices: (A) 1584 (B) 1120 (C) 792 (D) 1320 (E) 1200
                 The perimeter of the sheet is 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. The area of the sheet can be found by using the formula for the area of a rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is A = l x w, where l is the length of the rectangle and w is the width of the rectangle. In this case, the length of the rectangle is 48cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the width of the rectangle is 66cm when folded along the other set of sides. Therefore, the area of the sheet can be found by plugging in the values for l and w into the formula for the area of a rectangle. A = l x w = 48 x 66 = 1584 cm^2

The largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 12. This is because when k = 12, the discriminant (b2 - 4ac) = (5)2 - 4(1)(12) = 25 - 48 = -23 < 0, which means that the equation has no real roots. However, when k = 11, the discriminant = (5)2 - 4(1)(11) = 25 - 44 = -19 < 0, which means that the equation has no real roots. Therefore, the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is 12.<|end_of_text|>

The cross-section of a canal is shaped like a trapezium. If the canal is 10 m wide at the top and 6 m wide at the bottom and the area of cross-section is 640 square meters, the depth of cannel is? Answer Choices: (A) 26 (B) 28 (C) 21 (D) 80 (E) 23
                 The area of a trapezium is given by the formula: Area = 1/2 * (a + b) * h, where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides and h is the height of the trapezium.
                 In this case, a = 10 m, b = 6 m, and h is the depth of the canal.
                 To find the depth of the canal, we need to solve the equation: Area = 1/2 * (a + b) * h
                 640 = 1/2 * (10 + 6) * h
                 640 = 1/2 * 16 * h
                 640 = 8 * h
                 h = 80 m
                 Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 m.
