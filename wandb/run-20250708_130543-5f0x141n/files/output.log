Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 32 crackers and 98 cakes initially. How many crackers did each person eat?
                 The number of crackers each person ate can be calculated by dividing the total number of crackers by the number of people.
                 The total number of crackers is 32, and the number of people is 4, so the number of crackers each person ate is 32 ÷ 4 = 8 crackers.
                 The number of cakes each person ate can be calculated by dividing the total number of cakes by the number of people.
                 The total number of cakes is 98, and the number of people is 4, so the number of cakes each person ate is 98 ÷ 4 = 24 cakes.
                 Therefore, each person ate 8 crackers and 24 cakes.<|end_of_text|>

Emily is making bead necklaces for her 44 friends. She made 26 necklaces and each necklace takes 2 beads. How many beads did Emily have?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of beads that Emily used to make 26 necklaces.
                 We know that each necklace takes 2 beads, so we can multiply the number of necklaces by 2 to get the total number of beads.
                 26 necklaces x 2 beads per necklace = 52 beads.
                 Therefore, Emily used 52 beads to make 26 necklaces for her 44 friends.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar, 6 cups of flour, and 9 cups of salt. She already put in 12 cups of flour. How many more cups of sugar than cups of salt does she need to add now?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups of salt from the number of cups of sugar.
                 11 cups of sugar - 6 cups of flour = 5 cups of sugar
                 9 cups of salt - 12 cups of flour = -3 cups of salt
                 5 cups of sugar - (-3 cups of salt) = 8 cups of sugar
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 8 cups of sugar to the cake.
                 Note: In this problem, we subtracted the number of cups of salt from the number of cups of sugar to find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of salt she needs to add.

Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends. If he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially. How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
                 The number of crackers and cakes each person ate can be calculated by dividing the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends.
                 The total number of crackers and cakes is 13 + 15 = 28.
                 The number of friends is 28.
                 The number of crackers and cakes each person ate can be calculated by dividing 28 by 28, which is equal to 1.
                 Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake.

The number of campers that went rowing in the afternoon is 17. This can be determined by subtracting the number of campers that went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers that went rowing that day. The number of campers that went rowing in the morning is 15, and the total number of campers that went rowing that day is 32. Therefore, the number of campers that went rowing in the afternoon is 32 - 15 = 17.
                ### Explanation:
                To determine the number of campers that went rowing in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers that went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers that went rowing that day. The number of campers that went rowing in the morning is 15, and the total number of campers that went rowing that day is 32. Therefore, the number of campers that went rowing in the afternoon is 32 - 15 = 17.

Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days?
                 The number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 146 days can be calculated by multiplying the number of drums of grapes filled per day by the number of days in 146 days. The number of drums of grapes filled per day is 244, and the number of days in 146 days is 146. Therefore, the number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 146 days can be calculated by multiplying 244 by 146, which equals 35,504 drums of grapes.

Paul had 95 pens and 153 books. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 13 books and 23 pens left. How many books did he sell in the garage sale?
                 Let x be the number of books Paul sold in the garage sale.
                 95 + 153 = x + 13 + 23
                 95 + 153 = x + 36

Carol was sending out birthday invitations to her friends. Each package of invitations she bought had 10 invitations in it and she bought 7 packs. If she sends invitations to only 2 friends. How many invitations will be left?
                 The number of invitations that will be left after sending invitations to only 2 friends is 8. This is because there are 7 packs of 10 invitations each, and she sends invitations to only 2 friends. Therefore, the number of invitations that will be left after sending invitations to only 2 friends is 8.
                 To calculate the number of invitations that will be left after sending invitations to only 2 friends, we need to subtract the number of invitations that were sent from the total number of invitations. The total number of invitations is 70 (7 packs of 10 invitations each), and the number of invitations that were sent is 2. Therefore, the number of invitations that will be left after sending invitations to only 2 friends is 70 - 2 = 8.
                 In conclusion, the number of invitations that will be left after sending invitations to only 2 friends is 8. This is because there are 7 packs of 10 invitations each, and she sends invitations to only 2 friends.

If you have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies. How many cookies does each bag have?
                 There are 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies.
                 The number of cookies in each bag is 14/7 = 2 cookies.
                 Therefore, each bag has 2 cookies.
                ### Explanation:
                In this problem, we are asked to find the number of cookies in each bag if we have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies.
                To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags to get the number of cookies in each bag.
                Since we have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags, the number of cookies in each bag is 14/7 = 2 cookies.
                This means that each bag has 2 cookies.
                Therefore, the correct response is "There are 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies.
                The number of cookies in each bag is 14/7 = 2 cookies.
                Therefore, each bag has 2 cookies."

Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. If he had 10 crackers and 8 cakes initially. How many cakes did each person eat?
                 The number of cakes each person ate can be calculated by dividing the total number of cakes by the number of people.
                 In this case, there are 4 people, so the number of cakes each person ate is equal to 8 divided by 4, which is 2.
                 Therefore, each person ate 2 cakes.

Therefore, the grocery store had 41 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 51 days of harvest?
                 The number of sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest will be 74 x 51 - 71 x 51.
                 74 x 51 = 3784
                 71 x 51 = 3631
                 3784 - 3631 = 153
                 Therefore, the number of sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest will be 153.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, 10 cups of flour, and 15 cups of salt. She already put in 6 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour does she need to add?
                 To answer this question, we need to calculate the total amount of flour needed for the recipe. We know that the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, 10 cups of flour, and 15 cups of salt. We also know that Mary has already put in 6 cups of flour. Therefore, we need to calculate the total amount of flour needed for the recipe by subtracting the 6 cups of flour that Mary has already put in from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe.
                 The total amount of flour called for in the recipe is 3 cups of sugar + 10 cups of flour + 15 cups of salt = 28 cups of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed for the recipe is 28 cups of flour - 6 cups of flour = 22 cups of flour.
                 Mary needs to add 22 cups of flour to the cake batter to complete the recipe.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvested 56 sacks of oranges. How many sacks did they harvest per day if they harvested for a total of 14 days?
                 The number of sacks of oranges harvested per day can be calculated by dividing the total number of sacks of oranges harvested (56) by the total number of days the oranges were harvested (14).
                 Therefore, the number of sacks of oranges harvested per day is 56 ÷ 14 = 4 sacks of oranges per day.
                 It is important to note that this calculation assumes that the number of sacks of oranges harvested per day was constant throughout the 14-day harvesting period. If the number of sacks of oranges harvested per day varied, the calculation would need to take that into account.<|end_of_text|>

Being his favorite, he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop. He was told by 235 of the pickers that they fill 100 drums of raspberries per day and 221 drums of grapes per day. How many drums of grapes would be filled in 77 days?
                 The number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 77 days can be calculated by multiplying the number of drums of grapes filled per day by the number of days in 77 days.
                 The number of drums of grapes filled per day is 221.
                 The number of days in 77 days is 77.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar, 7 cups of flour, and 4 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?
                 To answer this question, we need to calculate the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups of salt from the number of cups of flour.
                 9 cups of sugar - 7 cups of flour = 2 cups of flour
                 4 cups of salt - 2 cups of flour = 2 cups of salt
                 The difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt is 2 cups of flour - 2 cups of salt = 0 cups of flour.
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 0 cups of flour and 2 cups of salt to complete the recipe.

Dan has $ 3. He bought 2 candy bar for $ 4, each one costing the same amount of money. How much did each candy bar cost?
                 Each candy bar cost $ 2.
                ### Explanation:
                The question is asking how much did each candy bar cost?
                To solve this problem, we need to divide the total cost of the candy bars by the number of candy bars.
                The total cost of the candy bars is $ 4.
                The number of candy bars is 2.
                Therefore, the cost of each candy bar is $ 4 divided by 2, which is $ 2.
                Therefore, each candy bar cost $ 2.

If you had 4 bags with equal number of cookies and 36 cookies in total. How many cookies does each bag have?
                 The number of cookies in each bag would be 36/4 = 9. Therefore, each bag would have 9 cookies.
                 This is because the number of cookies in each bag is equal to the total number of cookies divided by the number of bags.
                 In this case, the total number of cookies is 36 and the number of bags is 4, so the number of cookies in each bag would be 36/4 = 9.

                 Danny found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. To find the number of more bottle caps than wrappers, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps.
                 50 - 46 = 4
                 Therefore, Danny found 4 more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.

Helen the hippo and her friends are preparing for thanksgiving at Helen's house. Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday 270 cookies this morning and 419 cookies the day before yesterday. How many cookies did Helen bake till last night?
                 Helen baked 31 cookies yesterday, 270 cookies this morning, and 419 cookies the day before yesterday. This means that she baked a total of 820 cookies till last night.
                 To find out how many cookies she baked till last night, we need to subtract the number of cookies she baked yesterday from the total number of cookies she baked till last night.
                 820 - 31 = 789
                 This means that Helen baked 789 cookies till last night.

Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 4 groups. Rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles. How many eggs will each group have?
                 To split a collection of eggs into 4 groups, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of groups. In this case, we have 8 eggs and 6 marbles, so we need to divide 8 by 4 to get the number of eggs in each group.
                 8 ÷ 4 = 2
                 So, each group will have 2 eggs.
                 To get the number of marbles in each group, we need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of groups. In this case, we have 6 marbles, so we need to divide 6 by 4 to get the number of marbles in each group.
                 6 ÷ 4 = 1.5
                 So, each group will have 1.5 marbles.

There are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard. If there are 2 sets of tables, each having the same number of chairs, then the number of chairs for each table is 6. This can be calculated by dividing the total number of chairs (12) by the number of tables (2). The result is 6, which is the number of chairs for each table.
                ### Explanation:
                To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of chairs (12) by the number of tables (2). This gives us the number of chairs for each table, which is 6. Therefore, there are 6 chairs for each table in the backyard.

He needs 481 g of wax to stick the feathers together.
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the total amount of wax required and the amount of wax he currently has. The total amount of wax required is 492 g. The amount of wax he currently has is 11 g. The difference between these two numbers is 481 g. Therefore, he needs 481 g of wax to stick the feathers together.

Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 41 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 450 pages. It took Frank 30 days to finish the book. How many pages did he read per day?
                 The number of pages Frank read per day can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages in the book by the number of days it took him to finish the book. In this case, the total number of pages is 450 and the number of days it took him to finish the book is 30. Therefore, the number of pages Frank read per day is 450/30 = 15 pages per day.
                 Another way to calculate the number of pages Frank read per day is to divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters in the book. In this case, the total number of pages is 450 and the number of chapters is 41. Therefore, the number of pages Frank read per chapter is 450/41 = 11 pages per chapter. Since each chapter has the same number of pages, the number of pages Frank read per day can be calculated by multiplying the number of pages per chapter by the number of chapters in the book. In this case, the number of pages

                 The total number of crackers and cakes is 29 + 30 = 59.
                 If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 2 friends, then the number of crackers given to each friend is 29/2 = 14.5.
                 The number of cakes given to each friend is 30/2 = 15.
                 The number of cakes eaten by each friend is 15 - 14.5 = 0.5.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour, 14 cups of sugar, and 7 cups of salt. She already put in 2 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of salt does she need to add now?
                 To answer this question, we need to calculate the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups of salt from the number of cups of flour.
                 12 cups of flour - 2 cups of flour = 10 cups of flour
                 14 cups of sugar - 2 cups of sugar = 12 cups of sugar
                 7 cups of salt - 2 cups of salt = 5 cups of salt
                 The difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of salt is 10 cups of flour - 5 cups of salt = 5 cups of flour.
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour than cups of salt to complete the recipe.

If the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet. How far is the end of the cave?
                 The end of the cave is 388 feet away from the starting point.
                 To calculate the distance between the starting point and the end of the cave, we need to subtract 919 feet from 1307 feet.
                 1307 - 919 = 388.
                 Therefore, the end of the cave is 388 feet away from the starting point.
                 This means that the cave is 919 feet deep and they need to travel 1307 feet to reach the end of the cave.
                 To calculate the distance between the starting point and the end of the cave, we need to subtract 919 feet from 1307 feet.

The number of ripe apples that the tree had to begin with was 5. This is because 3 ripe apples were picked from the tree, leaving 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples. Therefore, the number of ripe apples that the tree had to begin with was 2 + 27 = 29 - 3 = 5.
                ### Explanation:
                To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of ripe apples that the tree had to begin with. We know that 3 ripe apples were picked from the tree, leaving 2 ripe apples and 27 unripe apples. Therefore, the number of ripe apples that the tree had to begin with was 2 + 27 = 29 - 3 = 5.<|end_of_text|>

Paul had 42 pens and 143 books. After selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 113 books and 19 pens left. How many pens did he sell in the garage sale?
                 Let x be the number of pens Paul sold in the garage sale.
                 42 + x = 113
                 42 + x - 42 = 113 - 42

David did 36 more push-ups but 33 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today. If Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches. How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
                 Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches.
                 David did 36 more push-ups but 33 less crunches than Zachary in gym class today.
                 36 + 33 = 69
                 58 - 33 = 25
                 69 - 25 = 44
                 Therefore, Zachary did 44 more push-ups than crunches.

                 After 73 days of harvest, they will have 5 sacks of ripe oranges. This is because 25 sacks of unripe oranges and 5 sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day. Therefore, after 73 days of harvest, they will have 25 x 73 = 1825 sacks of unripe oranges and 5 x 73 = 365 sacks of ripe oranges. The total number of sacks of ripe oranges will be 1825 + 365 = 2190.

After eating a hearty meal they went to see the Buckingham palace. There, Rachel learned that 45 visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day. If 829 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days. How many visitors visited the Buckingham palace on that day?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day. We can do this by subtracting the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day from the total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days.
                 The total number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace within the past 85 days is 829.
                 The number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on the previous day is 45.
                 Therefore, the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day is 829 - 45 = 784.
                 Therefore, the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham palace on that day is 784.

If there are 3 red peaches and some more green peaches in the basket, and there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket, then the number of green peaches in the basket is 13.
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green peaches in the basket. We know that there are 3 red peaches and some more green peaches in the basket. We also know that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket. To find the number of green peaches in the basket, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches. The number of red peaches is 3, and the number of green peaches is 10 more than the number of red peaches. So, the number of green peaches is 10 + 3 = 13. Therefore, the number of green peaches in the basket is 13.

Carol was sending out birthday invitations to 10 friends. If each package of invitations she bought had 2 invitations in it. How many packs does she need so that no friend gets left out?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the number of packages of invitations that Carol needs to buy so that no friend gets left out.
                 We know that each package of invitations has 2 invitations in it, and we also know that Carol is sending out birthday invitations to 10 friends.
                 To find the number of packages of invitations that Carol needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of invitations by the number of invitations in each package.
                 In this case, the total number of invitations is 10, and the number of invitations in each package is 2.
                 Therefore, the number of packages of invitations that Carol needs to buy is 10 ÷ 2 = 5.
                 In other words, Carol needs to buy 5 packages of invitations so that no friend gets left out.
                 This means that each package of invitations has 2 invitations in it, and Carol is sending out birthday invitations to 10 friends.

Frank was reading through his favorite book. The book had 3 chapters, each with the same number of pages. It has a total of 594 pages. It took Frank 607 days to finish the book. How many pages are in each chapter?
                 The number of pages in each chapter can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by the number of chapters. In this case, the total number of pages is 594, and the number of chapters is 3. Therefore, the number of pages in each chapter is 594/3 = 198 pages.
                 To calculate the number of days it took Frank to finish each chapter, we can divide the total number of days by the number of chapters. In this case, the total number of days is 607, and the number of chapters is 3. Therefore, the number of days it took Frank to finish each chapter is 607/3 = 203 days.
                 Finally, to calculate the number of pages in each chapter, we can multiply the number of pages in each chapter by the number of days it took Frank to finish each chapter. In this case, the number of pages in each chapter is 198, and the number of days it took Frank to finish each chapter is 203

In a school there are 402 more girls than boys. If there are 739 girls. How many boys are there in that school?
                 There are 402 more girls than boys in a school. If there are 739 girls, then there must be 739 - 402 = 337 boys in the school.
                 To find the number of boys in the school, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of students.
                 739 - 402 = 337
                 Therefore, there are 337 boys in the school.

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 31 sacks of ripe oranges and 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day. How many sacks of unripe oranges will they have after 45 days of harvest?
                 The number of sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvest can be calculated by multiplying the number of sacks of unripe oranges per day (24) by the number of days (45). Therefore, the number of sacks of unripe oranges after 45 days of harvest is 24 x 45 = 1080 sacks of unripe oranges.<|end_of_text|>

Matthew had 14 crackers and 21 cakes. If Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 7 friends. How many crackers and cakes did each person eat?
                 The number of crackers and cakes that each person ate can be calculated by dividing the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of people. In this case, the total number of crackers and cakes is 14 + 21 = 35, and the number of people is 7. Therefore, the number of crackers and cakes that each person ate is 35 ÷ 7 = 5 crackers and 3 cakes. This means that each person ate 5 crackers and 3 cakes.<|end_of_text|>

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 9 cups of sugar, 14 cups of flour, and 40 cups of salt. She already put in 4 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
                 To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of sugar. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups of flour from the number of cups of sugar.
                 9 cups of sugar - 4 cups of flour = 5 cups of sugar
                 14 cups of flour - 4 cups of flour = 10 cups of flour
                 The difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of sugar is 5 cups of sugar - 10 cups of flour = -5 cups of flour
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 cups of flour to the cake to make up for the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of sugar.

The number of pastries that baker would still have is 45.
                 To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of pastries that baker sold from the total number of pastries that baker made.
                 148 - 103 = 45
                 Therefore, the number of pastries that baker would still have is 45.

In a school there are 362 boys and 257 girls. 403 more girls joined the school. How many more girls than boys does the school have?
                 The number of girls in the school is 257 + 403 = 660.
                 The number of boys in the school is 362.
                 The difference between the number of girls and the number of boys is 660 - 362 = 298.
                 Therefore, the school has 298 more girls than boys.

                 There are 74 freshwater aquariums and 22 saltwater aquariums. Each aquarium has 46 animals in it. Therefore, there are 74 x 46 freshwater animals and 22 x 46 saltwater animals.

Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour, 2 cups of sugar, and 80 cups of salt. She already put in 7 cups of flour. How many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now?
                 To answer this question, we need to calculate the difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of sugar. We can do this by subtracting the number of cups of flour from the number of cups of sugar.
                 10 cups of flour - 7 cups of flour = 3 cups of flour
                 2 cups of sugar - 0 cups of sugar = 2 cups of sugar
                 The difference between the number of cups of flour and the number of cups of sugar is 3 cups of flour - 2 cups of sugar = 1 cup of flour.
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 cup of flour to the recipe.
                 Note: This is just one possible way to solve this problem. There may be other ways to approach it, depending on the specific details of the recipe and the ingredients available.<|end_of_text|>
