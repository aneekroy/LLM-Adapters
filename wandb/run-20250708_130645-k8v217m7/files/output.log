Allen, Shiela’s brother, likes to play with blocks. Shiela repainted Allen’s old blocks in different colors. If Allen has 49 identical blocks and there are 7 blocks for every color of paint used, how many colors did Shiela use?
                 The number of colors used by Shiela can be calculated by dividing the total number of blocks by the number of blocks for every color of paint used.
                 49 ÷ 7 = 7
                 Therefore, Shiela used 7 colors of paint to repaint Allen’s old blocks.
                 Note that this calculation assumes that the number of blocks for every color of paint used is a whole number. If the number of blocks for every color of paint used is not a whole number, then the calculation may need to be adjusted to account for the fractional number of blocks for each color of paint used. For example, if the number of blocks for every color of paint used is 6.5, then the calculation would need to be adjusted to account for the fractional number of blocks for each color of paint used. In this case, the calculation would need to be adjusted to account for the fractional number of blocks for each color of paint used. In this case, the calculation would need to be adjusted to

Joan found 6 seashells and Jessica found 8 seashells on the beach. How many seashells did they find together?
                 The total number of seashells that Joan and Jessica found together is 6 + 8 = 14 seashells.
                 ### Explanation:
                 To find the total number of seashells that Joan and Jessica found together, we need to add the number of seashells that Joan found (6) to the number of seashells that Jessica found (8). This gives us a total of 6 + 8 = 14 seashells. Therefore, the total number of seashells that Joan and Jessica found together is 14 seashells.

Melanie, Benny, Sandy, and Jessica each have 9 dozen Pokemon cards.  How many Pokemon cards do they have in all?
                 The total number of Pokemon cards that Melanie, Benny, Sandy, and Jessica have in all is 324.  This is because each of them has 9 dozen Pokemon cards, and there are 12 Pokemon cards in a dozen.  Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards that Melanie, Benny, Sandy, and Jessica have in all is 9 dozen x 12 Pokemon cards per dozen = 9 dozen x 12 Pokemon cards = 324 Pokemon cards.

There were 700 sheets of used paper. Lexie wants to place it in boxes for recycling. If every box can contain 100 sheets, how many boxes does Lexie need?
                 The number of boxes Lexie needs to place the 700 sheets of used paper in for recycling is 7. This is because 700 divided by 100 is 7 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, Lexie needs 7 boxes to place the 700 sheets of used paper in for recycling.
                 To calculate the number of boxes Lexie needs to place the 700 sheets of used paper in for recycling, divide 700 by 100. The result is 7 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, Lexie needs 7 boxes to place the 700 sheets of used paper in for recycling.

There are 1680 calories in 42 candy bars.
                ### Explanation:
                There are 4 dozen calories in a candy bar, so there are 4 x 12 = 48 calories in 1 dozen candy bars.
                There are 42 candy bars, so there are 42 x 48 = 2016 calories in 42 candy bars.
                Therefore, there are 1680 calories in 42 candy bars.

For his long distance phone service Milan pays a 2 dollars monthly fee plus 12 cents per minute. Last month, Milan's long distance bill was 23.36 dollars. For how many minutes was Milan billed for?
                 23.36 dollars = 2 dollars + 12 cents per minute
                 23.36 dollars = 2 dollars + (12/100) dollars
                 23.36 dollars = 2 dollars + 0.12 dollars
                 23.36 dollars = 2.12 dollars
                 2.12 dollars = 2 dollars + 0.12 dollars
                 2.12 dollars = 2 dollars + (12/100) dollars
                 2.12 dollars = 2 dollars + 12 cents
                 2.12 dollars = 12 cents + 2 dollars

There will be a total of 83 dogwood trees in the park when the workers are finished.
                ### Explanation:
                There are 34 dogwood trees currently in the park. Park workers will plant  49 more dogwood trees today. How many dogwood trees will the park have when the workers are finished?
                To find the total number of dogwood trees in the park when the workers are finished, we need to add the number of dogwood trees currently in the park and the number of dogwood trees that will be planted today.
                The number of dogwood trees currently in the park is 34. The number of dogwood trees that will be planted today is 49.
                To find the total number of dogwood trees in the park when the workers are finished, we need to add the number of dogwood trees currently in the park and the number of dogwood trees that will be planted today.
                The total number of dogwood trees in the park when the workers are finished is 34 + 49 = 83.
                Therefore, there will be a total of 83 dogwood trees in the park when the workers are finished.

The junior ranger asked Christian to help him place 420 seedlings in packets. If every packet needs to contain 7 seeds, how many packets do they need?
                 To solve this problem, we need to divide 420 by 7 to get the number of packets needed.
                 420 ÷ 7 = 60
                 Therefore, 60 packets are needed to place 420 seedlings in packets.<|end_of_text|>

                 The total weight of the two pumpkins is 12.7 pounds.
                 To find the total weight of the two pumpkins, we add the weight of the first pumpkin (4 pounds) and the weight of the second pumpkin (8.7 pounds).

If 56 wood carvings were displayed, how many shelves were filled with carvings?
                 The number of shelves filled with carvings can be calculated by dividing the total number of carvings by the maximum number of carvings that can be placed on a single shelf.
                 In this case, the total number of carvings is 56 and the maximum number of carvings that can be placed on a single shelf is 8.
                 Therefore, the number of shelves filled with carvings is 56/8 = 7.
                 This means that 7 shelves were filled with carvings.

Seth bought 20 cartons of ice cream and 2 cartons of yogurt. Each carton of ice cream cost $6 and each carton of yogurt cost $1. How much more did Seth spend on ice cream than on yogurt?
                 The total cost of the ice cream is 20 * 6 = 120 and the total cost of the yogurt is 2 * 1 = 2. Therefore, the difference between the cost of the ice cream and the cost of the yogurt is 120 - 2 = 118. Therefore, Seth spent $118 more on ice cream than on yogurt.

There are 96 cupcakes for 8 children to share. How much will each person get if they share the cupcakes equally?
                 Each person will get 12 cupcakes if they share the cupcakes equally.
                 To find the answer, we need to divide 96 by 8.
                 96 ÷ 8 = 12.
                 Therefore, each person will get 12 cupcakes if they share the cupcakes equally.
