To find out how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden would need to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom, we need to calculate two thirds of 36 sq ft first. Two thirds of 36 sq ft is (2/3) * 36 = 24 sq ft. Since Mr Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his bathroom. The answer is 576.<|eot_id|>

The farm has 30 cows and the zoo has 20 sheep.  The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.  This means that the zoo has 30 x 2 = 60 cows.  The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.  This means that the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep.  The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, for a total of 30 + 10 = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, for a total of 60 + 20 = 80 animals.  The farm and zoo have a combined total of 40 + 80 = 120 animals.  The answer is 120.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we first need to find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day. Since Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar, and Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day, Edgar's brother eats 18 x 1/2 = 9 pretzels a day. To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we need to multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7. 9 x 7 = 63. Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance, we first need to determine the speed of the car in the slow lane. Since the car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and the car in the slow lane is traveling at half that speed, we can calculate the speed of the car in the slow lane by dividing the speed of the car in the fast lane by 2.
                 Speed of the car in the slow lane = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour
                 Now that we know the speed of the car in the slow lane, we can calculate the time it took to cover 480 miles by dividing the distance by the speed.
                 Time = Distance / Speed
                 Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour
                 Time = 16 hours
                 Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set, we need to subtract the cost of the headphone set from the total amount he paid. Since we don't know the cost of the headphone set, let's call it x. We know that the cost of the CD is $4, and the total amount paid is $48. So, we can set up the equation 4 + x = 48. Solving for x, we get x = 48 - 4 = 44. This means that the headphone set costs $44. Now that we know the cost of the headphone set, we can find out how many more CDs Tom would have been able to buy if he had not bought the headphone set. We can do this by dividing the cost of the headphone set by the cost of the CD: 44 ÷ 4 = 11. Therefore, Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we first need to calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys. Since there are 20 kids in total and they were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys, there must be 10 girls and 10 boys. The boys brought back 60 shells each, so the total number of seashells brought by the boys is 60 * 10 = 600.
                 Since the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys, the girls brought 600 + 4 * 60 = 600 + 240 = 840 seashells in total.
                 To find out how many seashells were brought by each girl, we need to divide the total number of seashells brought by the girls by the number of girls, which is 840 / 10 = 84.

To find out how many signatures the sisters need to collect to reach their goal, we need to subtract the total number of signatures they already have from their goal of 100 signatures. The total number of signatures they already have is 20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64. To find the number of signatures they need to collect, we subtract 64 from 100. 100 - 64 = 36. Therefore, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.<|eot_id|>

To find the total amount of water that the dehumidifier removed from the air in Brian's basement, we need to calculate the amount of water removed at each setting and add them together.
                 The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.  Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the low setting, the total amount of water removed at the low setting is 1 * 3 = 3 liters.
                 The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes 2 * 1 = 2 liters of water per day.  Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 3 days on the medium setting, the total amount of water removed at the medium setting is 2 * 3 = 6 liters.
                 The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes 2 * 2 = 4 liters of water per day.  Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for 5 days on the high setting, the total amount of water removed at the high setting is 4 * 5 = 20 liters.

To determine the total time Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the time it takes him to drive to the museum and the time it takes him to drive back home.  Since he drives at a constant speed of 75 mph, we can use the formula time = distance / speed.  The distance to the museum is 150 miles, so the time it takes him to drive to the museum is 150 / 75 = 2 hours.  Since he drives the same distance back home, the time it takes him to drive back home is also 2 hours.  Therefore, the total time he spends driving is 2 + 2 = 4 hours.  Adding the 6 hours he spends at the museum, the total time he is gone from home is 4 + 6 = 10 hours.  The answer is 10 hours.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we need to calculate the time it takes to ride each slide and then subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide.
                 First, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
                 Time = Distance / Speed
                 Time = 300 feet / 60 feet/minute
                 Time = 5 minutes
                 Next, let's calculate the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
                 Time = Distance / Speed
                 Time = 240 feet / 80 feet/minute
                 Time = 3 minutes
                 Finally, let's subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
                 Time difference = Time for biggest slide - Time for second biggest slide
                 Time difference = 5 minutes - 3 minutes
                 Time difference = 2 minutes
                 Therefore, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.<|eot_id|>

To find the weight that Jamaal now uses, we need to first find the weight that he increased the original weight by. 50% of 8 pounds is 0.5 x 8 = 4 pounds. So, the weight that he increased the original weight by is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. Jamaal uses a weight two pounds lighter than that, so the weight that he now uses is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds. The answer is 10 pounds.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we need to calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees and the time it takes to cook the chicken.
                 The time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees is 40% longer than the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  40% of 20 minutes is 0.4 x 20 = 8 minutes.  Therefore, the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees is 20 + 8 = 28 minutes.
                 The time it takes to cook the chicken is 5 minutes less than the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees.  Therefore, the time it takes to cook the chicken is 28 - 5 = 23 minutes.
                 The total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is the sum of the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees and the time it takes to cook the chicken.  Therefore, the total time is 28 + 23 = 51 minutes.

To find the height of the tallest tree, we need to calculate the combined height of the two shorter trees first. The shortest tree is 6 feet tall, and the second tree is 5 feet more than the shortest tree, so the second tree is 6 + 5 = 11 feet tall. The combined height of the two shorter trees is 6 + 11 = 17 feet. The height of the tallest tree is twice the combined height of the two shorter trees, so the tallest tree is 2 x 17 = 34 feet tall. Therefore, the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard is 34 feet tall.<|eot_id|>

To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone, we need to determine how many percentage points are left to reach 100%. Since the phone is currently at 60% charged, there are 100% - 60% = 40% left to charge. Since the phone recharges at the rate of 1 percentage-point of charge per 3 minutes, it will take 40 percentage points * 3 minutes/percentage point = 120 minutes to fully charge the phone. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 120 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 120 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 2 hours. Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.<|eot_id|>

First, we need to find out how much money Kassidy has. Since Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, and Aurelia has $120, Kassidy has 3/4 * $120 = $90. Then, we need to find out how much money Rayna has. Since Rayna has $60 more than Kassidy, Rayna has $90 + $60 = $150. Now that we know how much money each of them has, we can find out how much money they would have if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them. The total amount of money is $120 + $90 + $150 = $360. If they share equally, each of them would have $360 / 3 = $120. Therefore, Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia would each have $120 if they decided to add together their money and share equally among them.<|eot_id|>

Since there are 4 weeks in 4 weeks, she will eat 21 x 4 = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 84 by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks.  84 ÷ 12 = 7.  Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.

To find out how many marbles Paul has left, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Paul has after his friend gave him 28 marbles.
Total marbles = 52 + 28 = 80
Step 2: Calculate 1/4 of the total number of marbles Paul has.
1/4 of 80 = 80 / 4 = 20
Step 3: Subtract the number of marbles Paul lost from the total number of marbles he had.
Marbles left = Total marbles - Marbles lost
Marbles left = 80 - 20
Marbles left = 60
Therefore, Paul has 60 marbles left.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of beads, we need to add the beads from her mother, sister, and friend: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 beads. Therefore, Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches, we first need to convert the height from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 = 240 inches. Since the bamboo grows 30 inches a day, we can divide 600 inches by 30 inches/day to find the number of days it will take to reach 600 inches. 600 ÷ 30 = 20 days. Therefore, it will take 20 days for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then add them together.
                 On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.
                 On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 cakes.
                 On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is 5 x 12 = 60 cakes.
                 To find the total number of cakes, we add the number of cakes she bought each day: 4 + 12 + 60 = 76 cakes.

To find the total length of the baked goods, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the length of the rolls. There are 300 rolls, each 4 inches long, so the total length of the rolls is 300 x 4 = 1200 inches.
                 Next, let's calculate the length of the croissants. There are 120 croissants, each 6 inches long, so the total length of the croissants is 120 x 6 = 720 inches.
                 Finally, let's calculate the length of the baguettes. There are 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long, so the total length of the baguettes is 60 x 2 = 120 feet.
                 Now, let's add the lengths of the rolls, croissants, and baguettes together. 1200 + 720 + 120 = 2040 inches.
                 Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the total length from inches to feet by dividing by 12. 2040 ÷ 12 = 170 feet.

To determine the price of the crate of fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the cost of the bananas. There are 5 bananas in the crate, and each banana costs twice as much as an apple. Since an apple costs $0.5, a banana costs $0.5 * 2 = $1. Therefore, the total cost of the bananas is 5 * $1 = $5.
                 Next, let's calculate the cost of the apples. There are 12 apples in the crate, and each apple costs $0.5. Therefore, the total cost of the apples is 12 * $0.5 = $6.
                 Now, let's calculate the cost of the oranges. There are 7 oranges in the crate, and each orange costs three times as much as a banana. Since a banana costs $1, an orange costs $1 * 3 = $3. Therefore, the total cost of the oranges is 7 * $3 = $21.

To find the number of students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year, we need to calculate 20% of the number of students enrolled last year and add it to the number of students enrolled last year.
                 20% of 50 is 0.2 x 50 = 10.
                 So, the number of students enrolled this year is 50 + 10 = 60.
                 Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.
                 Alternatively, we can calculate the increase in enrollment by multiplying the number of students enrolled last year by 20% (or 0.2).
                 50 x 0.2 = 10.
                 So, the number of students enrolled this year is 50 + 10 = 60.

To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book to the distribution center. The book weighs 4 pounds, and the shipping company charges $0.35 per pound, so the shipping cost for the weight is 4 x $0.35 = $1.40. The book needs to be shipped 20 miles, and the shipping company charges $0.08 per mile, so the shipping cost for the distance is 20 x $0.08 = $1.60. The total shipping cost is $1.40 + $1.60 = $3.00. Since Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, the refund will be 75% of $32, which is 0.75 x $32 = $24.00. To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund from the shipping cost, which is $3.00 - $24.00 = -$21.00. Since Milly will lose $21.00, she will lose 21 dollars. The negative sign indicates that Milly will lose money.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to first calculate how much each of them earned.  Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, for a total of 3 hours.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours on Saturday.  He worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 x 1 = 3 hours on Sunday.  In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.  Jill worked 3 hours, so she earned 3 x $10 = $30.  John worked 7 hours, so he earned 7 x $10 = $70.  To find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, we need to subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.  $70 - $30 = $40.  Therefore, John earned $40 more than Jill.<|eot_id|>

To find the age of one of the twins, let's denote the age of one triplet as x. Since one twin is 7 years older than one triplet, the age of the twin would be x + 7. The combined ages of the twins and triplets would be 3x + (x + 7) = 44. Combining like terms, we get 4x + 7 = 44. Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 4x = 37. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 9.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we'll round down to 9 for the age of the triplet. The age of the twin would be 9 + 7 = 16. Therefore, one of the twins is 16 years old.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we need to know how many silver coins she has. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, we can represent the number of silver coins as x and the number of gold coins as x + 30. We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 30) = 110. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. This means that Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, Gretchen has 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins. Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many cards Becca has, we need to set up an equation.  Let x be the number of cards that PJ has.  Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, Smendrick has 3x cards.  Since Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, Becca has 3x + 12 cards.  The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation x + 3x + 3x + 12 = 341.  Combining like terms, we get 7x + 12 = 341.  Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 7x = 329.  Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 47.  Since Becca has 3x + 12 cards, Becca has 3(47) + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 cards.  Therefore, Becca has 153 cards.<|eot_id|>

Since the vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it, let x be the number of votes against the new regulation. Then, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x. Since the total number of votes is 33, we can set up the equation x + 2x = 33. Combining like terms, we get 3x = 33. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 11. Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2(11) = 22.

To find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records, we first need to calculate the total time he will spend on rounds and appointments. For the rounds, he has 9 inpatients and each round takes 20 minutes, so the total time spent on rounds is 9 x 20 = 180 minutes. For the appointments, he has 10 appointments and each appointment takes 30 minutes, so the total time spent on appointments is 10 x 30 = 300 minutes. The total time spent on rounds and appointments is 180 + 300 = 480 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time spent on rounds and appointments is 480 / 60 = 8 hours. Since Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records. The answer is 1 hour.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pounds of ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month, we first need to determine how much ore one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since a steel pickaxe mines 50% more ore than an iron pickaxe, and an iron pickaxe mines 12 pounds of ore per day, a steel pickaxe mines 12 * 1.5 = 18 pounds of ore per day.
                 Next, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in one day. Since one dwarf with a steel pickaxe can mine 18 pounds of ore per day, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 40 * 18 = 720 pounds of ore per day.
                 Finally, we need to find out how much ore 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in 30 days. Since 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 720 pounds of ore per day, they can mine 720 * 30 = 21600 pounds of ore in 30 days.

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. We know that the total time it took to make the meal was 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 18) = 98. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98. Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. This means that Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes. Therefore, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we need to first find out how much money Rafaela received. Since each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip, we can multiply 40 by 20 to find the total amount of money Rafaela received. 40 x 20 = 800.
                 Since Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela, we need to find 10% of 800 and subtract it from 800 to find out how much money Julieta received. 10% of 800 is 0.1 x 800 = 80. Subtracting 80 from 800, we get 800 - 80 = 720.
                 To find out how much money Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether, we need to add the amount of money Rafaela received and the amount of money Julieta received. 800 + 720 = 1520.

To find out how many screws James will have left over, we need to calculate the total number of screws needed for the 4 tables.  Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, the total number of screws needed is 4 x 4 x 2 = 32.  Since James has 40 screws, the number of screws he will have left over is 40 - 32 = 8.  Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we must first determine how many pounds of gravel Gordy's truck can carry.  Since Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, and Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.  Now that we know how many pounds of gravel Gordy's truck can carry, we can find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry.  Since the three trucks combined can haul 11,600 pounds of gravel, and Gissela and Gordy's trucks can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds of gravel, Gary's truck must be able to haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds of gravel.  Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.  The answer is 2,800.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to first find out how much she earns in one day. Since Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour, Karen earns $10 x 2 = $20 per hour.
                 Since Karen works 3 hours per day, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per day. $20 x 3 = $60 per day.
                 To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her daily wage by 2. $60 x 2 = $120.

To find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now, we need to determine their current ages. We know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother.
                 Let's denote the current age of Emil's dad as D and the current age of his brother as B. When Emil turns 24, his age will be 24, his dad's age will be 2 * 24 = 48, and his brother's age will be 24 / 2 = 12.
                 Since we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother, we can set up the following equations:
                 24 = (1/2)D
                 24 = 2B
                 Solving the first equation for D, we get:
                 D = 2 * 24
                 D = 48
                 Solving the second equation for B, we get:
                 B = 24 / 2
                 B = 12
                 Therefore, the current age of Emil's dad is 48, and the current age of his brother is 12. The sum of their

To find the percentage of the cars that are semi-automatic, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. Since there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, the number of semi-automatic cars is 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4. To find the percentage, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars (4) by the total number of cars (20) and multiply by 100. This gives us (4 / 20) * 100 = 20%. Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to first calculate how much she pays each month. Since she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, we need to calculate 50% of the minimum payment and add it to the minimum payment.
                 For her student loans, the minimum payment is $300. 50% of $300 is $150, so she will pay $300 + $150 = $450 per month.
                 For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200. 50% of $200 is $100, so she will pay $200 + $100 = $300 per month.
                 For her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500. 50% of $500 is $250, so she will pay $500 + $250 = $750 per month.
                 Now that we know how much she pays each month, we can calculate how much she pays in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the monthly payment by 12.
                 For her student loans, $450 x 12 = $5,400 per year.
                 For her credit card, $300 x 12 = $3,600 per year.

To determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the total height of all the girls in the pyramid. We know that 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60" tall.

To find out how many books Joseph currently has, we need to first determine how many books he had before he lost any. Since Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books, and Sarah had 9 books, Joseph had 2 x 9 = 18 books. After losing 2 books, Joseph now has 18 - 2 = 16 books. Therefore, Joseph currently has 16 books.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to calculate the number of each color of eggs and then add them together.
                 First, Cindy had 5 green eggs. Since she had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.
                 Next, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.
                 Finally, she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.
                 To find the total number of eggs, we add the number of eggs of each color together: 5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27 eggs.
                 Therefore, Cindy had 27 eggs altogether.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it took James to get across the lake, we need to break down his journey into three segments: swimming 60% of the distance, resting on the island, and swimming the remaining 40% of the distance.
Step 1: Calculate the time it took James to swim 60% of the distance.
60% of 20 miles is 0.6 * 20 = 12 miles.  Since James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, the time it took him to swim 12 miles is 12 / 2 = 6 hours.
Step 2: Calculate the time James spent resting on the island.
James rested for half as long as the swimming time.  Since he swam for 6 hours, he rested for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.
Step 3: Calculate the time it took James to swim the remaining 40% of the distance.
40% of 20 miles is 0.4 * 20 = 8 miles.  Since James swims at a pace of 1 mile per hour (half his original speed), the time it took him to swim 8 miles is 8 / 1 = 8 hours.

To determine how many hours it will take Matthew to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes, we need to calculate the total time it will take him to dig all the holes.
                 First, we calculate the time it will take to dig the small holes: 30 small holes * 3 minutes per hole = 90 minutes.
                 Next, we calculate the time it will take to dig the large holes: 15 large holes * 10 minutes per hole = 150 minutes.
                 Then, we add the time it will take to dig the small holes to the time it will take to dig the large holes: 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.
                 Finally, we convert the total time from minutes to hours: 240 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 4 hours.
                 Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take Phineas to return home, we need to calculate the time it takes for him to hop on land and the time it takes for him to swim in the water.  Since half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can assume that the distance on land is 100 yards and the distance in water is also 100 yards.
                 First, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to hop 100 yards on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.  We can do this by dividing the distance (100 yards) by the speed (20 yards per minute), which gives us 100/20 = 5 minutes.
                 Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for Phineas to swim 100 yards in the water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.  We can do this by dividing the distance (100 yards) by the speed (10 yards per minute), which gives us 100/10 = 10 minutes.

To determine how much James saved by picking his own blueberries, we need to calculate the total cost of the blueberries he picked and compare it to the cost of buying them at the store.
                 First, let's calculate the total cost of the blueberries James picked.  He picked 30 pounds of blueberries at $1.5 per pound, so the total cost is 30 x $1.5 = $45.
                 Next, let's calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store.  The cost of buying 30 pounds of blueberries at $2.5 per pound is 30 x $2.5 = $75.
                 To find out how much James saved by picking his own blueberries, we need to subtract the cost of the blueberries he picked from the cost of buying them at the store.  $75 - $45 = $30.

To determine how many times each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup, we first need to calculate how much soup will be left after dinner. Since Calvin and his wife are adults and will eat four bowls, and the two children will eat two bowls, the total number of bowls eaten at dinner will be 4 + 2 = 6 bowls. Since the pot can fill four adult's bowls or eight child's bowls, the total capacity of the pot is 4 * 2 = 8 bowls. After dinner, there will be 8 - 6 = 2 bowls of soup left. Since there are two children, each child will be able to have 2 / 2 = 1 bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup. Therefore, each child will be able to have a bowl of soup for lunch from the leftover soup one time.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first need to find out how many pounds of comic books he is removing. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, 30 comic books will weigh 30 x 1/4 = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds. Since Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds from his book bag, he needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds of toys. Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we can divide 7.5 by 1/2 to find out how many toys he needs to remove. 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 x 2 = 15. Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

                First, we need to find out how much she spends on food per month. Since food costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply $25 by 4 to get $100 per month.

                Then, we need to find out how much she spends on medicine per month. Medicine costs $100 per month.
                Now, we need to add up how much she spends on food, treats, and medicine per month. $100 (food) + $20 (treats) + $100 (medicine) = $220 per month.
                Finally, we need to multiply how much she spends per month by 12 to find out how much she spends per year. $220 per month * 12 months per year = $2,640 per year.

To determine how many weeks it will take Nate to fill in all the holes, we need to calculate the total number of holes that need to be filled. Nate's dog dug 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the total number of holes dug is 6 * 14 = 84 holes. Nate then fills in 9 holes a day, but the dog digs 6 new holes every night. This means that the net number of holes filled per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes. To find out how many days it will take to fill in all the holes, we divide the total number of holes by the net number of holes filled per day: 84 / 3 = 28 days. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide 28 by 7 to get the number of weeks: 28 / 7 = 4 weeks. Therefore, it will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day, we need to calculate how many pieces he chews throughout the day and then subtract that from the total number of pieces he started with.
                 First, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews at school.  Since he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, and he's at school for 8 hours, he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum at school.
                 Next, let's calculate how many pieces of gum Jim chews on the way home from school and after dinner.  He chews 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner, for a total of 1 + 1 = 2 pieces of gum.
                 So, in total, Jim chews 4 + 2 = 6 pieces of gum throughout the day.
                 To find out how many pieces of gum Jim has left, we need to subtract the number of pieces he chews from the total number of pieces he started with.  He started with 20 pieces of gum, so he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.

To find the final value of the number train, we need to follow the given instructions step by step.
Step 1: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20. So, the starting value is 20.
Step 2: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5. First, we need to find half of the starting value, which is 20 / 2 = 10. Then, we add 10 to the starting value: 20 + 10 = 30. Finally, we divide 30 by 5: 30 / 5 = 6.
Step 3: The resulting value (6) was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. First, we subtract 12 from the starting value: 20 - 12 = 8. Then, we multiply 6 by 8: 6 * 8 = 48.
Therefore, the final value of the number train is 48.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we need to first calculate the number of ruined castles. 40 percent of 220 castles are ruins, so we multiply 220 by 0.4 to find the number of ruined castles. 0.4 x 220 = 88.  Since half of the ruined castles are unmanned, we divide the number of ruined castles by 2 to find the number of unmanned ruined castles. 88 / 2 = 44.

Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, we can divide the remaining 60% by 20% to find the number of days.
                 60% ÷ 20% = 3

Three baskets of red food will cost 3 x $18 = $54. Since you get $2 off for each basket of red food, subtract $2 x 3 = $6 from the cost of the red food. The new cost of the red food is $54 - $6 = $48. Now, add the cost of the green food and the new cost of the red food. The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.

To determine the number of balloons Sally finally carried into the school, we need to calculate the number of balloons she had after each event.
                 Initially, Sally had 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons, for a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.
                 40% of the 25 red balloons burst, which is 0.4 * 25 = 10 balloons. So, she was left with 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons.

To calculate the total number of letters in the words that Craig and his brother have spelled after the ten rounds, we need to add the total number of letters in the words that Craig has spelled to the total number of letters in the words that Craig's brother has spelled.
Craig has spelled 20 words with 15 letters each, so the total number of letters in the words that Craig has spelled is 20 x 15 = 300.
Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig, so the total number of letters in the words that Craig's brother has spelled is 300 + 50 = 350.
Therefore, the total number of letters in the words that Craig and his brother have spelled after the ten rounds is 300 + 350 = 650.

To find out how much Stephen will pay in the twelfth month, we first need to calculate the interest he owes. The interest is 2% of $300, which is 0.02 x $300 = $6. So, the total amount Stephen owes is $300 + $6 = $306. Since Stephen will pay $25 per month for 11 months, the total amount he will pay in the first 11 months is $25 x 11 = $275. To find out how much he will pay in the twelfth month, we need to subtract the amount he paid in the first 11 months from the total amount he owes.

Total number of seats = Number of rows * Number of seats per row
Total number of seats = 4 * 18
Total number of seats = 72
Step 2: Calculate the number of seats occupied by the administrators.
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * Total number of seats
Number of seats occupied by administrators = (1/4) * 72
Number of seats occupied by administrators = 18
Step 3: Calculate the number of remaining seats.
Number of remaining seats = Total number of seats - Number of seats occupied by administrators
Number of remaining seats = 72 - 18
Number of remaining seats = 54
Step 4: Calculate the number of seats occupied by the parents.
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * Number of remaining seats
Number of seats occupied by parents = (1/3) * 54

To determine the number of good oranges in the basket, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges that are not good. We know that 1 orange is bad, 20% are unripe, and 2 are sour. The percentage of oranges that are not good is 1 (bad) + 20% (unripe) + 2 (sour) = 23%. Therefore, the percentage of oranges that are good is 100% - 23% = 77%. To find the number of good oranges, we multiply the total number of oranges (25) by the percentage of good oranges (77% or 0.77). Therefore, the number of good oranges is 25 x 0.77 = 19.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of an orange, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 19 good oranges in the basket.<|eot_id|>

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 5 feet.  Therefore, the volume of the pool is 6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet.  Since it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill the pool, the total cost to fill the pool is 120 x $.1 = $12.00.  The cost to fill the pool is $12.00.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to first find out how many eggs he sells per week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can multiply the number of eggs he sells per day (252) by 7 to get the number of eggs he sells per week. 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week. Next, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs he sells per week. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide the number of eggs he sells per week (1764) by 12 to get the number of dozens of eggs he sells per week. 1764 / 12 = 147 dozens of eggs per week. Finally, we can multiply the number of dozens of eggs he sells per week (147) by the price per dozen ($2) to find out how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week. 147 * $2 = $294 per week. Therefore, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much John makes in a week, we need to first find out how much he makes in a day.  Since he does 30 cycles of work a day and each cycle has 5 different tasks, we can multiply the number of cycles by the number of tasks to find the total number of tasks he does in a day.  30 cycles * 5 tasks/cycle = 150 tasks per day.  Since each task pays $1.20, we can multiply the number of tasks by the pay per task to find his daily earnings.  150 tasks * $1.20/task = $180 per day.  Since he works 7 days a week, we can multiply his daily earnings by 7 to find his weekly earnings.  $180 per day * 7 days/week = $1260 per week.  Therefore, John makes $1260 per week if he works a full 7 day week.<|eot_id|>

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  He drives 100 miles a day for a 30 day month.  To determine how many tune-ups he needs, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in 30 days.  Since he drives 100 miles a day, we multiply 100 miles by 30 days to get 3000 miles.  Since his car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, we divide 3000 miles by 1000 to get 3.  Therefore, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much profit Tim makes from selling 10 jars of the honey and jam mix, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for 10 jars and subtract that from the total amount of money he makes from selling 10 jars.
                 First, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients for 10 jars.  For each jar, it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1.5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey.  So, for 10 jars, we need 10 x 2 = 20 pounds of passion fruit, 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of jackfruit, and 10 x 2 = 20 pounds of honey.
                 The cost of the passion fruit is 20 x $6 = $120.  The cost of the jackfruit is 15 x $8 = $120.  The cost of the honey is 20 x $10 = $200.
                 The total cost of the ingredients for 10 jars is $120 + $120 + $200 = $440.

To find out how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to first calculate the total cost of the bolts. Since each bolt costs $0.03 and David is buying 16 bolts, the total cost of the bolts is 16 x $0.03 = $0.48. To find out how much money David has left, we need to subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has. So, we subtract $0.48 from $12.48. $12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00. Therefore, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.<|eot_id|>

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we first need to find the height of the first floor. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, we can multiply Mattison's height by 7 to find the height of the first floor: 60 inches * 7 = 420 inches. The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so we can multiply Mattison's height by 3 to find the height of the first floor: 60 inches * 3 = 180 inches. Since the height of the first floor is 420 inches and the height of the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 180 inches, we can subtract the height of the floor to the ceiling on the first floor from the height of the first floor to find the height of the second floor: 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches. Since the house is 7 times as high as Mattison, we can multiply Mattison's height by 6 to find the height of the roof: 60 inches * 6 = 360 inches.

To find out how many emails Robyn sends to her boyfriend, we first need to find out how many emails are not work emails. Since she sends seven work emails a day, she sends 16 - 7 = 9 emails that are not work emails. Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, so two-thirds of 9 is (2/3) * 9 = 6 emails to family. This leaves 9 - 6 = 3 emails that are not to family or work. One-third of the other emails are to her boyfriend, so one-third of 3 is (1/3) * 3 = 1 email to her boyfriend. Therefore, Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many lemons Tim will need, we first need to determine how many gallons of lemonade he will make in total.  He will make 4 gallons for the party and an extra gallon for Allen, so he will make a total of 5 gallons.  Since his recipe calls for 1 cup of lemon juice per gallon, he will need 5 cups of lemon juice.  Since 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice, he will need 5 x 6 = 30 lemons to make 5 gallons of lemonade.  To make an extra gallon that is twice as tart as the other gallons, he will need twice as many lemons, which is 30 x 2 = 60 lemons.  Therefore, Tim will need a total of 30 + 60 = 90 lemons to make 5 gallons of lemonade, including the extra gallon that is twice as tart.  The answer is 90.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many red and blue shoe boxes are left in Tim's box, we need to subtract the number of blue and red shoe boxes he used from the total number of blue and red shoe boxes he originally had.
                 First, let's find out how many red shoe boxes Tim used. Since he used 1/3 of his red shoe boxes, we can multiply the total number of red shoe boxes (9) by 1/3.

To find the cost of one monitor, we first need to determine the cost of the printer. Since Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer, we can calculate the cost of the printer by subtracting $400 from the cost of the computer. The cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700. Next, we subtract the cost of the computer and the printer from the total cost to find the combined cost of the two monitors. The combined cost of the two monitors is $2,400 - $1,100 - $700 = $600. To find the cost of one monitor, we divide the combined cost of the two monitors by 2. The cost of one monitor is $600 ÷ 2 = $300. Therefore, one monitor cost $300.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Mark paid for the new radiator, we need to calculate the cost of the radiator first.  The cost of the radiator is $400, but he gets it for 80% off, so we need to calculate 80% of $400 and subtract it from $400.  80% of $400 is 0.8 x $400 = $320.  So the cost of the radiator is $400 - $320 = $80.  Next, we need to calculate the cost of the installation.  The mechanic charges $50 an hour and it takes 3 hours, so the cost of the installation is $50 x 3 = $150.  To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the installation.  The total cost is $80 + $150 = $230.  Therefore, Mark paid $230 for the new radiator.<|eot_id|>

                 The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays in the station for 20 minutes, so it will leave the station in 10 + 20 = 30 minutes.

The price of the blue car is $100. Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we can calculate the price of the red car by finding 40% of the price of the blue car and subtracting it from the price of the blue car. 40% of $100 is 0.4 x $100 = $40. Subtracting $40 from the price of the blue car, we get $100 - $40 = $60. Therefore, the price of the red car is $60. The total cost of both cars is $100 + $60 = $160.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many hours James runs a week, we need to multiply the number of miles he runs per day by the number of days he runs per week, and then divide by the number of miles he runs per hour.
                 12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week
                 60 miles/week ÷ 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

Let's say Brad gets x dollars. Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x dollars. The total amount of money is 100 dollars, so we can set up the equation x + 4x = 100. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 100. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 20. Since Jeff gets 4x dollars, Jeff gets 4(20) = 80 dollars. Therefore, Jeff gets 80 dollars.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many days the loaf of bread will last, we need to calculate how many slices each person eats per day. Abby eats 2 slices a day, and Josh eats twice as much, so Josh eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day. Together, they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day. To find out how many days the loaf of bread will last, we divide the total number of slices (24) by the number of slices they eat per day (6). 24 ÷ 6 = 4.

To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to first find out how many trees each of them has.  Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.  Since Chris has 6 trees, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.  Twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has is 2 * 3 = 6.  5 more than 6 is 6 + 5 = 11.  Therefore, Harry has 11 trees.  To find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard, we need to subtract the number of trees that Ferdinand has from the number of trees that Harry has.  11 - 3 = 8.

To find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on gumballs. Since he bought 40 gumballs for $0.05 each, we can multiply the number of gumballs by the cost per gumball to find the total cost of the gumballs.
                 40 gumballs * $0.05 per gumball = $2
                 Since Billy took half of his change and spent it on gumballs, we know that the $2 he spent on gumballs is half of his total change. To find his total change, we can multiply the amount he spent on gumballs by 2.
                 $2 * 2 = $4
                 Since Billy started with $10 and spent $4 on gumballs, we can subtract the cost of the gumballs from his initial amount of money to find out how much he spent on candy.
                 $10 - $4 = $6
                 Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, we can divide the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound to find out how many pounds of candy he bought.
                 $6 / $1.5 per pound = 4

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards, then multiply by 100.
                 First, we need to find the total number of cards. The total number of cards is 30 + 20 + 40 = 90.
                 Next, we need to find the number of water type cards. The number of water type cards is 40 - 8 = 32.
                 Now, we can divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards: 32 / 90 = 0.3556.
                 Finally, we can multiply by 100 to get the percentage chance: 0.3556 * 100 = 35.56%.
                 Rounding 35.56% to the nearest integer, we get 36%.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the shares after the first year.
The initial value of the shares is 8 shares * $8 per share = $64.
The stock price increases by 50%, so the new value is $64 + ($64 * 0.50) = $96.
Step 2: Calculate the value of the shares after the second year.
The stock price decreases by 25%, so the new value is $96 - ($96 * 0.25) = $72.

To determine the number of flights to France the first plane takes in one day, we need to calculate the total number of flights it makes and then find half of that number. Since the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany, we can start by finding the total number of flights it makes. We know that the second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. Therefore, the first plane makes twice as many trips as the second plane, which is 44 * 2 = 88 trips. Since three-quarters of the flights are to Greece, the number of flights to Greece is 88 * (3/4) = 66 flights. The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. Therefore, the number of flights to France is 22 / 2 = 11 flights. So, the first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Define the original speed difference between Lee and Gerald
Let's denote Gerald's original speed as G and Lee's original speed as L. According to the problem, L = G + 2.
## Step 2: Calculate Gerald's original speed
We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, which is 2 seconds faster than Gerald's original time. Therefore, Gerald's original time is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, we can calculate Gerald's original speed as G = 400 / 40 = 10 meters per second.
## Step 3: Calculate Gerald's improved speed
Since Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%, we can calculate his improved speed as 1.1 * G = 1.1 * 10 = 11 meters per second.
## Step 4: Calculate Gerald's improved time
Since speed is inversely proportional to time, we can calculate Gerald's improved time as 400 / 11 = 36.36 seconds.
The final answer is: $\boxed{36.36}$<|eot_id|>

Finally, let's calculate the number of blue birds in the 1 tree with 3 blue birds:
1 tree * 3 blue birds/tree = 3 blue birds
Now, let's add up the total number of blue birds:
21 blue birds + 8 blue birds + 3 blue birds = 32 blue birds
Therefore, there were 32 blue birds in the trees in total.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we first need to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have individually. Since Sean has 56 marbles and Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has 4 x 56 = 224 marbles. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, Cal has 2 x 56 = 112 marbles. To find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we need to add the number of marbles Carl and Cal have individually. Carl has 224 marbles and Cal has 112 marbles, so Carl and Cal have 224 + 112 = 336 marbles combined. The answer is 336.<|eot_id|>

Walt walked 4 miles on Monday. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday. To find out how many miles he walked on Wednesday, we need to subtract the miles he walked on Monday and Tuesday from his total mileage. 41 - 4 - 24 = 13. Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday. The answer is 13.<|eot_id|>

Brittany and her mom go to the museum. The cost of admission is $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. If she received $8 in change, how much money, in dollars, did she give the cashier?
To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets. The child ticket costs $10 and the adult ticket costs $12, so the total cost is $10 + $12 = $22. Since Brittany's mom received $8 in change, she must have given the cashier $22 - $8 = $14.

To determine how many new tables the charity group needs, we first need to calculate the total number of boxes of stuff they have.  They have 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that is 10 x 5 = 50 boxes.  They also have 10 boxes of their own, so that is a total of 50 + 10 = 60 boxes.  Since they can fit 2 boxes per table, we need to divide the total number of boxes by 2.  60 boxes / 2 boxes per table = 30 tables.  Since they already have 15 tables, they need 30 - 15 = 15 new tables.  Therefore, the charity group needs 15 new tables for their yard sale.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we first need to calculate how many cookies each of them ate. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies. In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies, while her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Since 1 cookie has 200 calories, Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. Therefore, Sue consumed 9200 - 3600 = 5600 more calories than her sister.

Since there are 8 rooms, half of the rooms is 4 rooms and the other half is also 4 rooms. The total number of small candles is 4 small candles/room x 4 rooms = 16 small candles. The total number of medium candles is 5 medium candles/room x 4 rooms = 20 medium candles. The total number of candles is 16 small candles + 20 medium candles = 36 candles.

To find the number of students in the smallest group, let's denote the number of students in the two equal-sized groups as x. Since the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.
                 We know that the total number of students is 200, so the sum of the students in all three groups is equal to 200. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
                 2x + (x - 10) = 200
                 Solving for x, we get:
                 2x + x - 10 = 200
                 3x - 10 = 200
                 3x = 200 + 10
                 3x = 210
                 x = 210 / 3
                 x = 70
                 Since x represents the number of students in each of the two equal-sized groups, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60.

To find out how many gumballs Colby can buy, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has and then divide it by the cost of a single gumball, which is 5 cents.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of money Colby has:
                 8 quarters = 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents
                 6 dimes = 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents
                 14 nickels = 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents
                 15 pennies = 15 x 1 cent = 15 cents
                 Total amount of money = 200 cents + 60 cents + 70 cents + 15 cents = 345 cents
                 Since each gumball costs 5 cents, we can divide the total amount of money by the cost of a single gumball:
                 345 cents / 5 cents = 69 gumballs
                 Therefore, Colby can buy 69 gumballs.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many hours the firefighters have to fundraise in total to reach their goal, we need to first find out how much more money they need to raise. We can do this by subtracting the amount they have already raised ($2100) from their goal ($6300). This gives us $6300 - $2100 = $4200. This means they need to raise an additional $4200. Since they raise an equal amount in every hour, we can divide the amount they need to raise ($4200) by the number of hours they have already worked (3 hours). This gives us $4200 ÷ 3 = $1400 per hour. To find the total number of hours they need to work, we can divide the amount they need to raise ($4200) by the amount they raise per hour ($1400). This gives us $4200 ÷ $1400 = 3 hours. Therefore, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 3 + 3 = 6 hours to reach their goal.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we first need to find the total number of girls in the class. Since 2/5 of the students are boys, 3/5 of the students are girls. We can find the number of girls by multiplying 3/5 by the total number of students (200).
                 3/5 * 200 = 120
                 Since 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, we can find the number of girls in the girl scout by multiplying 2/3 by the total number of girls.
                 2/3 * 120 = 80
                 To find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.
                 120 - 80 = 40

To calculate the total amount Ariadne made in two months, we first need to find out how much she made in the first month. We know that her sales from red hats were $400 in the first month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Therefore, the total sales from green hats in the first month is $400 * 2 = $800. The total sales from both red and green hats in the first month is $400 + $800 = $1200. In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month, which is 3/4 * $1200 = $900. The total amount she made in two months is $1200 + $900 = $2100. Therefore, Ariadne made a total of $2100 in two months.<|eot_id|>

To find the length of the longer piece of the board, we need to divide the total length of the board (40 feet) by 5. This is because the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, so we can represent the length of the shorter piece as x and the length of the longer piece as 4x. Since the total length of the board is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces, we can write the equation x + 4x = 40. Combining like terms, we get 5x = 40. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get x = 8. Since the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece, the length of the longer piece is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet. Therefore, the longer piece of the board is 32 feet long.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of groups that can perform in the concert, we need to calculate the total amount of time available for performances. The concert is 2 hours long, which is equivalent to 120 minutes. Subtracting the intermission time of 10 minutes, we have 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances. Each group requires 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group. To find the number of groups that can perform, we divide the available performance time (110 minutes) by the time required per group (10 minutes). 110 ÷ 10 = 11. Therefore, Vicki can allow 11 groups to perform in the concert.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used that day, we need to calculate the number of tickets they used on the roller coaster and the number of tickets they used on the luge, and then add them together.
                First, let's calculate the number of tickets they used on the roller coaster. Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times, so the total number of times they rode the roller coaster is 2 + 4 = 6. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets they used on the roller coaster is 6 x 6 = 36.
                Next, let's calculate the number of tickets they used on the luge. Each of them rode the luge 2 times, so the total number of times they rode the luge is 2 + 2 = 4. Since each ride costs 6 tickets, the total number of tickets they used on the luge is 4 x 6 = 24.
                Now, let's add the number of tickets they used on the roller coaster and the number of tickets they used on the luge to find the total number of tickets they used that day. 36 + 24 = 60.

To find out how much Johnny lost on average that day, we need to calculate the total amount he lost and then divide it by the number of races.
                 First, we know he lost $5 on the first race. On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. Since he lost $5 on the first race, twice that amount is $10, and $1 more than that is $11. So, he won $11 on the second race.
                 On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. Since he won $11 on the second race, 1.5 times that amount is $16.50. So, he lost $16.50 on the third race.
                 The total amount he lost is $5 (first race) + $16.50 (third race) = $21.50.
                 To find the average amount he lost, we divide the total amount he lost ($21.50) by the number of races (3).
                 $21.50 ÷ 3 = $7.17
                 Therefore, Johnny lost an average of $7.17 that day.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many emails James responds to in a 5 day work week, we need to first find out how many emails don't require any response.  20% of 80 emails is 0.2 x 80 = 16 emails.  Since 16 emails don't require any response, James will respond to 80 - 16 = 64 emails in a day.  In a 5 day work week, James will respond to 64 x 5 = 320 emails.  The answer is 320.<|eot_id|>

To determine Janeth's remaining balance, we need to calculate the total amount she will pay in 12 months and subtract it from the initial amount she borrowed.
First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth will pay in 12 months. She will pay $165 a month for 12 months, so the total amount she will pay is:
$165 x 12 = $1980
Since Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount, the total amount she needs to return is:
$2000 + ($2000 x 0.10) = $2000 + $200 = $2200
Now, let's calculate Janeth's remaining balance by subtracting the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to return:
$2200 - $1980 = $220
Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months will be $220.<|eot_id|>

To find Marcus' total bill, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items he ordered and then apply the 10% discount.
First, let's calculate the total cost of the croissants:
5 croissants at $3.00 apiece = 5 x $3.00 = $15.00
Next, let's calculate the total cost of the cinnamon rolls:
4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each = 4 x $2.50 = $10.00
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the mini quiches:
3 mini quiches at $4.00 each = 3 x $4.00 = $12.00
Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the blueberry muffins:
13 blueberry muffins at $1.00 each = 13 x $1.00 = $13.00
Now, let's add up the total cost of all the items:

To determine how many seats Alex will need, we need to calculate the total number of people that will be attending the event. She initially invited 100 people, and each invited person said they would also invite 2 of their friends. This means that for each of the 100 invited people, there will be 2 additional people attending the event. So, the total number of people invited is 100 + (100 * 2) = 300. Then, Alex called 10 of her friends to invite them to the event, and 8 of them said they would be bringing their spouses. This adds 10 + 8 = 18 more people to the total. Therefore, the total number of people attending the event is 300 + 18 = 318. Alex will need 318 seats for the event.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade, we first need to calculate how many questions she got right on the first test. Since the first test has 70 questions and she got 60% of them correct, we can calculate the number of questions she got right by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage she got correct.
                 70 x 0.60 = 42
                 So, Audrey got 42 questions right on the first test.
                 Next, we need to calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right to pass the 6th grade. Since she needs to get 70% of the total questions correct, we can calculate the total number of questions she needs to get right by multiplying the total number of questions by the percentage she needs to get correct.

To determine the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend, we first need to find out how many dishes Judy brought. Since Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups, and she bought a dozen (12) cups, she must have bought 12 x 2 = 24 dishes.
                 Next, we need to find out how many dishes Judy's friend brought. Since Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy, and Judy brought 24 dishes, her friend must have brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.
                 To find the total number of utensils, we need to add the number of cups and dishes brought by Judy and her friend. Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, for a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils. Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, for a total of 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.
                 Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend is 36 + 84 = 120 utensils. The answer is 120.<|eot_id|>

To determine the minimum temperature of the second bottle, let's first calculate the total amount of water Donny has after pouring 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second bottle. He has a total of 4 + 1 = 5 ounces of water. Since Donny can now drink the water, the total temperature of the 5 ounces of water must be at least 40 degrees.
                 Let's assume the second bottle contains x ounces of water. Since Donny poured 1 ounce from the second bottle, the amount of water in the second bottle after pouring is x - 1 ounces.
                 The total temperature of the 5 ounces of water is the sum of the temperatures of the 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug and the x - 1 ounces from the second bottle. Since the temperature of the 33-degree mug is 33 degrees, the total temperature of the 4 ounces is 4 * 33 = 132 degrees.
                 The total temperature of the 5 ounces of water is at least 40 degrees, so we can set up the following inequality:
                 132 + (x - 1) ≥ 40
                 To solve for x, we can subtract 132 from both sides

To determine the number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices each friend eats and then multiply that by the number of friends.
                 Each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, for a total of 6 + 4 = 10 slices per friend.
                 Since there are 6 friends, the total number of slices needed is 10 * 6 = 60 slices.
                 Since the cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, Kate will need to buy 60 / 12 = 5 cheese pizzas.
                 Since the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, Kate will need to buy 60 / 8 = 7.5 pepperoni pizzas.
                 Since Kate cannot buy a fraction of a pizza, she will need to buy 8 pepperoni pizzas to have enough slices.

To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to subtract the number of penguins that jumped in the ocean and the number of penguins that went inside the cave from the total number of penguins.  One-third of 36 is 12, so 12 penguins jumped in the ocean.  One-third of 36 is 12, so 12 penguins went inside the cave.  36 - 12 - 12 = 12.  Therefore, 12 penguins are still left sunbathing.  The answer is 12.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many grams of protein John gets per week, we first need to find out how many grams of protein he gets per day.  Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, and John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 3/100 * 200 = 6 grams of protein per day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, John gets 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein per week.  Therefore, John gets 42 grams of protein per week.  The answer is 42.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much change Carly gets back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she ordered.
First, we calculate the cost of the hamburgers: 5 hamburgers * $4 each = $20.
Next, we calculate the cost of the potato fries: 10 packs * $0.30 each pack = $3.
Then, we calculate the cost of the fruit drinks: 5 cans * $2 each can = $10.
Now, we add up the costs of all the items: $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.
Finally, we subtract the total cost from the $50 bill Carly gave: $50 - $33 = $17.
Therefore, Carly gets $17 back as change.<|eot_id|>

To determine the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to first calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.  Since each box is $100.00 and is currently 10% off, we need to calculate the discount first.  The discount is 10% of $100.00, which is 0.10 x $100.00 = $10.00.  Therefore, the discounted price of each box is $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00.  Since Pete is buying 2 boxes, the total cost will be 2 x $90.00 = $180.00.  To find the cost of each pair of contacts, we need to divide the total cost by the number of pairs, which is 90.  Therefore, the cost of each pair of contacts will be $180.00 / 90 = $2.00.  The answer is $2.00.<|eot_id|>

To find the total yards of yarn used, we need to add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma. Mariah used 1/4 of a skein, and her grandma used 1/2 of a skein. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4 and 2 is 4. So, we can rewrite 1/2 as 2/4. Now we can add the fractions: 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4. Since there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, we can multiply 3/4 by 364 to find the total yards used: 3/4 * 364 = 273 yards. Therefore, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually and the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches, and then subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of the individual bananas.
                 First, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas individually. Since there are 10 bunches and each bunch contains 4 bananas, there are a total of 10 x 4 = 40 bananas. The cost of each banana is $0.80, so the total cost of buying the bananas individually is 40 x $0.80 = $32.00.
                 Next, let's calculate the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches. Jenny buys 10 bunches, and each bunch costs $3.00, so the total cost of buying the bananas in bunches is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.
                 To find out how much money Jenny saved by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually, we subtract the cost of the bunches from the cost of the individual bananas: $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00. Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00

To calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment, we first need to determine the number of faulty pieces of equipment. Since 40% of the total number of pieces of equipment were faulty, we can calculate the number of faulty pieces by multiplying the total number of pieces ($400000) by 40% (or 0.4).
                 Number of faulty pieces = $400000 * 0.4
                 Number of faulty pieces = $160000
                 Now that we know the number of faulty pieces, we can calculate the number of functioning pieces by subtracting the number of faulty pieces from the total number of pieces.
                 Number of functioning pieces = Total number of pieces - Number of faulty pieces
                 Number of functioning pieces = $400000 - $160000
                 Number of functioning pieces = $240000
                 Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money spent on functioning pieces of equipment by multiplying the number of functioning pieces by the cost of each piece.
                 Total amount of money spent on functioning pieces = Number of functioning pieces * Cost of each piece
                 Total amount of money spent on functioning pieces = $240000 * $400000
                 Total amount of money spent on functioning pieces = $96,000,000

To determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to calculate the number of miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the number of miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday.
                 From Monday to Friday, Pancho walks 20 miles a day. There are 5 days in this period, so he walks a total of 20 * 5 = 100 miles.
                 On Saturday and Sunday, Pancho walks 10 miles a day. There are 2 days in this period, so he walks a total of 10 * 2 = 20 miles.
                 To find the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to add the number of miles he walks from Monday to Friday and the number of miles he walks on Saturday and Sunday.
                 Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 100 + 20 = 120 miles.
                 The answer is 120.<|eot_id|>

To find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we first need to calculate the total amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange drink and the 15 liters of pineapple drink. The orange drink is two-thirds water, so the amount of water in the orange drink is 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters. The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 3/5 * 15 = 9 liters. The total amount of water in both drinks is 20/3 + 9 = 9 + 20/3 = (27 + 20)/3 = 47/3 liters. Then, we need to subtract the amount of water that was spilled, which is 1 liter, from the total amount of water. So, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 47/3 - 1 = 47/3 - 3/3 = (47 - 3)/3 = 44/3 liters. Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 44/3 liters.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of dromedaries in the herd, we can set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of camels as C and the number of dromedaries as D. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. Therefore, the total number of bumps can be represented as 2C + D = 304. We also know that the total number of heads is 180, which can be represented as C + D = 180. By solving these two equations simultaneously, we can find the values of C and D. Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get 2C - C = 304 - 180, which simplifies to C = 124. Substituting C = 124 into the second equation, we get 124 + D = 180, which simplifies to D = 56. Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, let's use variables to represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set. Let x be the number of balls retrieved in the second set. Then, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, and the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x / 2. The total number of balls retrieved is the sum of the balls retrieved in each set, which is given as 19. So, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 4) + (x / 2) = 19. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38. Combining like terms, we get 5x + 8 = 38. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 5x = 30. Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 6. Since the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is 6 + 4 = 10. Therefore, Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set of the match

To calculate the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that day, we need to first determine the distance Anis rowed. Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana, we can calculate Anis' distance by multiplying Dijana's distance by 1/5 and adding it to Dijana's distance.
                 Anis' distance = Dijana's distance + (Dijana's distance * 1/5)
                 Anis' distance = 50 + (50 * 1/5)
                 Anis' distance = 50 + 10
                 Anis' distance = 60
                 Now that we know Anis' distance, we can calculate the total distance by adding Dijana's distance and Anis' distance.
                 Total distance = Dijana's distance + Anis' distance
                 Total distance = 50 + 60
                 Total distance = 110
                 Therefore, the total distance Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is 110 miles.<|eot_id|>

To find Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings from teaching and coaching separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate her earnings from teaching. She works 35 hours a week at $20 per hour, so her weekly earnings from teaching are 35 * $20 = $700. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are $700 * 50 = $35,000.
                 Next, let's calculate her earnings from coaching. She works 15 hours a week at $30 per hour, so her weekly earnings from coaching are 15 * $30 = $450. Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are $450 * 50 = $22,500.
                 Now, let's add her annual earnings from teaching and coaching to find her total annual salary. $35,000 + $22,500 = $57,500.

To determine the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours, we need to calculate the number of jellyfish created per hour and then multiply it by the total number of hours.

To find out how much the builder earns in a year, we need to calculate the total number of days he works in a year. Since he works 6 days a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, the total number of days he works in a year is 6 * 52 = 312 days. Since he gets paid $50 every day, the total amount he earns in a year is 312 * $50 = $15,600. Therefore, the builder earns $15,600 in a year.<|eot_id|>

To find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used, we need to calculate the length of each glue stick that is not used and then add them together.
                 The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so we need to find 5/6 of the original length. 5/6 of 12 millimeters is (5/6) * 12 = 10 millimeters.
                 The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so we need to find 1/3 of the original length. 1/3 of 12 millimeters is (1/3) * 12 = 4 millimeters.
                 The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so we need to find 1/2 of the original length. 1/2 of 12 millimeters is (1/2) * 12 = 6 millimeters.
                 Now, we add the lengths of the glue sticks that are not used: 10 millimeters + 4 millimeters + 6 millimeters = 20 millimeters.
                 Therefore, the total length of the glue sticks that are not used is 20 millimeters.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much Theo has to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items he has already purchased. The cost of 6 business suits at $100 each is 6 x $100 = $600. The cost of 3 suitcases at $50 each is 3 x $50 = $150. The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit, which is 5 x $100 = $500. Therefore, the cost of the flight ticket is $500 + $700 = $1200. The total cost of the items he has already purchased is $600 + $150 + $1200 = $1950. Since Theo wishes to save $2000 for this trip, he has $6000 - $1950 - $2000 = $1050 left to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa. Therefore, Theo has to spend $1050 on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate how much they make in a day and then multiply that by the number of days they are open.
                 First, let's calculate how much they make in a day.  They get 6 reservations a night and each meal costs $5, so they make 6 x $5 = $30 per meal.  Since they order 2 meals per night, they make 2 x $30 = $60 per night.  Adding the $5 bottle of wine, they make $60 + $5 = $65 per night.
                 Since they are open 2 days a week, they make 2 x $65 = $130 per week.

To determine the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day.
                 First, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by these three people is 3 x 3 x 7 = 63 eggs.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day. Again, since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of eggs consumed by these two people is 2 x 2 x 7 = 28 eggs.
                 To find the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week, we need to add the number of eggs consumed by the three people who eat three eggs each day and the number of eggs consumed by the two people who eat two eggs each day. Therefore, the total number of eggs consumed by the family in a week is 63 + 28 = 91 eggs.

To calculate the cost of replacing Mike's movie collection with digital versions, we first need to determine the number of movies that are part of series and the number of older movies.
First, let's calculate the number of movies that are part of series.  Mike has 600 movies, and a third of them are in series.  A third of 600 is 600 / 3 = 200.  So Mike has 200 movies that are part of series.
Next, let's calculate the number of older movies.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies.  The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400.  40% of 400 is 0.4 x 400 = 160.  So Mike has 160 older movies.
Now that we know the number of movies that are part of series and the number of older movies, we can calculate the cost of replacing the movies.  The cost of the series is 200 x $6 = $1200.  The cost of the older movies is 160 x $5 = $800.  The cost of the normal movies is 400 x $10 = $4000.  The total cost is $1200 + $800 + $400

To find the total cost of the wardrobe, we need to calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 x $750 = $7,500.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, which is $750 x 1/5 = $150. Since James buys 10 dress pants, the total cost of the dress pants is 10 x $150 = $1,500.
Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, and he buys 10 suits, so he buys a total of 10 x 3 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 x $60 = $1,800.
Finally, let's add up the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost of the wardrobe. The total cost is $7,500 + $1,500 + $1,800

Let x be the runtime of Elaina's usual concerts. Since the final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts, the runtime of the final concert is 2x. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total runtime of the final concert is 2x + 15. Since the total runtime of the final concert is 65 minutes, we can set up the equation 2x + 15 = 65 and solve for x. Subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 50. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 25. Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many additional bottles of water Bill needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles he already has.  Since he started out with 2 cases of water and each case has 24 bottles, the total number of bottles he already has is 2 x 24 = 48 bottles.

To find out how many cookies Jenny eats, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box.  She puts 4 cookies in her son's lunch box 5 days a week, so the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box is 4 x 5 = 20 cookies.  Next, we need to calculate the total number of cookies her husband eats.  Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so the total number of cookies her husband eats is 1 x 7 = 7 cookies.  Now, we need to subtract the total number of cookies her husband eats and the total number of cookies she puts in her son's lunch box from the total number of cookies in the bag.  The total number of cookies in the bag is 36, so the number of cookies Jenny eats is 36 - 20 - 7 = 9 cookies.  Therefore, Jenny eats 9 cookies.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink, we first need to calculate the number of green and blue cars. Since they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars, the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10. Since they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, the number of blue cars is 3 * 10 = 30. The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52. Since the rink has 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23. Therefore, the bumper car rink has 23 yellow cars.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to determine how many sentences he edits for each publisher. Since Mark edits an equal number of sentences each week for both publishers, we can divide the total number of sentences by 2 to find the number of sentences for each publisher.
                 1000 sentences / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.
                 Since Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence, we can multiply the number of sentences he edits for Publisher A by 5 cents to find out how much he makes from Publisher A.
                 500 sentences * 5 cents/sentence = 2500 cents from Publisher A.
                 Since Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays, we can multiply the amount he makes from Publisher A by 2 to find out how much he makes from Publisher B.
                 2500 cents * 2 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.
                 To find the total amount Mark makes in a week, we can add the amount he makes from Publisher A and Publisher B.
                 2500 cents + 5000 cents = 7500 cents.
                 Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many hours Mike spends writing a week, we need to calculate the total number of pages he writes per week and then convert that to hours.
                 Mike used to have 5 pen pals, but he stopped being penpals with 2 of them, so he now has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
                 Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long, so each pen pal sends 2 x 5 = 10 pages per week.  Since Mike has 3 pen pals, he receives 3 x 10 = 30 pages per week.
                 Mike responds in kind, so he also sends 30 pages per week.
                 Mike can write a page every 6 minutes, so he can write 60 / 6 = 10 pages per hour.
                 Since Mike writes 30 pages per week, and he can write 10 pages per hour, he spends 30 / 10 = 3 hours per week writing.

To determine how long it would take John to speak 10 pages, we first need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages. Since each page has 450 words, the total number of words in 10 pages is 10 * 450 = 4500 words.
Next, we need to calculate John's new speaking speed, which is 2.5 times faster than his original speed. His original speed is 150 WPM, so his new speed is 2.5 * 150 = 375 WPM.
Now, we can calculate the time it would take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM. To do this, we divide the total number of words (4500) by his new speed (375 WPM). This gives us 4500 / 375 = 12 hours.
Therefore, it would take John 12 hours to speak 10 pages at his new speed of 375 WPM.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence.  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width.  In this case, L = 15 feet and W = 10 feet.  Plugging these values into the formula, we get P = 2(15) + 2(10) = 30 + 20 = 50 feet.  Since Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing he builds, he will need 2 x 50 = 100 wooden slats.  Therefore, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build the fence around his garden.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of years he has been on vacation. Since he goes on four vacations a year and has been vacationing since he was 23 years old, we can calculate the total number of years he has been on vacation by subtracting his starting age from his current age and then multiplying by the number of vacations per year.
                 Total years on vacation = (Current age - Starting age) * Vacations per year
                 Total years on vacation = (34 - 23) * 4
                 Total years on vacation = 11 * 4
                 Total years on vacation = 44
                 Since Gene has one shirt from each vacation, the total number of quilt blocks he has is equal to the total number of years he has been on vacation.
                 Total quilt blocks = Total years on vacation

To find out how many carrot sticks Matt has to eat, we need to set up an equation. Let's say the number of carrot sticks Matt eats is "x". Since he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra, we can write the equation as follows: (1/2)x + 2 = 5. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: (1/2)x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2. This simplifies to (1/2)x = 3. To get rid of the fraction, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: 2 * (1/2)x = 2 * 3. This simplifies to x = 6. Therefore, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to have 5 cookies in total.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many hours Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to after 5 days, we need to calculate the total time he spends on these activities each day and then multiply it by 5.
                 First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunch and breaks each day:
                 Lunch: 30 minutes
                 Break 1: 15 minutes
                 Break 2: 15 minutes
                 Total time per day: 30 + 15 + 15 = 60 minutes
                 Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
                 60 minutes ÷ 60 = 1 hour
                 Now, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on his lunches and breaks after 5 days:
                 Total time per day: 1 hour
                 Total days: 5
                 Total time after 5 days: 1 hour/day × 5 days = 5 hours
                 Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the time it takes to download the 200 GB file, we need to break it down into three parts: the initial download, the restart, and the second download.
First, Carla downloads 2 GB/minute. Since the total file size is 200 GB, we can calculate the time it takes to download the first 160 GB:
160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes
Next, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. So, the total time elapsed so far is:
80 minutes + 20 minutes = 100 minutes
Now, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. Since she has already downloaded 160 GB, she only needs to download the remaining 40 GB:
40 GB / 2 GB/minute = 20 minutes
Finally, we add the time it takes to download the remaining 40 GB to the total time elapsed so far:
100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes
Therefore, it takes Carla 120 minutes, or 2 hours, to download the 200 GB file.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to subtract the time it takes them to get to the library and the fire station from the total time they have to get to school.
                First, let's add the time it takes them to get to the library and the fire station: 6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes.
                Now, let's subtract the time it takes them to get to the library and the fire station from the total time they have to get to school: 30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes.

To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total number of minutes he spends in class and add the extra learning time he spends on Saturday and Sunday.
                 First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class.  There are 6 periods in the day for a normal student, but John has to take 2 extra classes.  Each class is 40 minutes long, and he goes to class for 5 days a week.  So, the total number of minutes John spends in class per week is:
                 6 periods x 40 minutes/period = 240 minutes
                 2 extra classes x 40 minutes/class = 80 minutes
                 240 minutes + 80 minutes = 320 minutes
                 Since John goes to class for 5 days a week, the total number of minutes he spends in class per week is:
                 320 minutes/day x 5 days/week = 1600 minutes/week
                 Next, we need to calculate the extra learning time John spends on Saturday and Sunday.  He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.  So, the total number of minutes he spends on Saturday and Sunday is:

To find out how many porcupines will be in the park after a year, we first need to determine the number of female porcupines in the park. Since the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, we can calculate this by multiplying the total population by 3/5.
                 Total population = 50
                 Number of female porcupines = 3/5 * 50
                 Number of female porcupines = 30
                 Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, we can calculate the total number of babies born in a month by multiplying the number of female porcupines by 4.
                 Total number of babies born in a month = 30 * 4
                 Total number of babies born in a month = 120
                 Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of babies born in a year by multiplying the total number of babies born in a month by 12.

To determine how long it will take Jay to have 60 snowballs, we need to consider the rate at which he builds snowballs and the rate at which they melt. Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour, which means he builds 20/60 = 1/3 of a snowball every 15 minutes. Since 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes, the net change in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes is 1/3 - 2 = -5/3 snowballs. This means that every 15 minutes, Jay loses 5/3 snowballs. To find out how many 15-minute intervals it will take for Jay to have 60 snowballs, we can divide 60 by the net change in the number of snowballs every 15 minutes, which is -5/3. This gives us 60 / (-5/3) = 60 * (-3/5) = -36. Since we can't have a negative number of snowballs, we need to round up to the nearest multiple of 15 minutes. The next multiple of 15 minutes is 45 minutes. Therefore, it will take Jay 45 minutes to have 60 snowballs.<|eot_id|>

To find the selling price of each watermelon, we first need to calculate the total selling price of all the watermelons. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80 and sold them at a 25% profit. To find the total selling price, we need to calculate 25% of $80 and add it to $80.
                 25% of $80 = 0.25 x $80 = $20
                 Total selling price = $80 + $20 = $100
                 Now that we know the total selling price of all the watermelons is $100, we can find the selling price of each watermelon by dividing the total selling price by the number of watermelons.
                 Selling price per watermelon = Total selling price / Number of watermelons
                 Selling price per watermelon = $100 / 50

To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to first find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we can multiply Harry's hours of sleep by 2/3 to find James' hours of sleep.
                 Harry slept 9 hours, so James slept 2/3 * 9 = 6 hours.
                 To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to subtract James' hours of sleep from Harry's hours of sleep.
                 9 - 6 = 3.
                 Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we first need to determine how many dumplings each male ate. Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by the males, we multiply the number of males by the number of dumplings each male ate: 8 males * 4 dumplings = 32 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings eaten by the females, we multiply the number of females by the number of dumplings each female ate: 6 females * 3 dumplings = 18 dumplings. To find the total number of dumplings, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the males and females: 32 dumplings + 18 dumplings = 50 dumplings. Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two months. 30% of 120 watermelons is 0.3 x 120 = 36 watermelons.
Step 2: Calculate the number of watermelons remaining after two months. 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons.
Step 3: Calculate the number of watermelons ready for harvest after two weeks. 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons is (3/4) x 84 = 63 watermelons.
Step 4: Calculate the number of watermelons not ready to be harvested after two weeks. 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons.
Therefore, 21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of legos that Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the number of pieces in each of the three boxes and then add them together.
                 The first box has 500 pieces.
                 The second box has 3 times more pieces than the first box, so it has 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
                 The third box has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first box, so it has 1/4 * 500 = 125 pieces.
                 To find the total number of legos, we add the number of pieces in each box: 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125.

To find the total number of likes, first, calculate the number of likes after three weeks. Since the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes, multiply the initial number of likes by 70. The initial number of likes was 2000, so the number of likes after three weeks is 2000 * 70 = 140000. Then, add the 20000 new likes to get the total number of likes. The total number of likes is 140000 + 20000 = 160000. The final answer is 160000.<|eot_id|>

Let x be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.  Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.  Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool now, the big pool has 4x gallons of water now.  Since the big pool loses 4 gallons/minute, the big pool has 4x - 16 gallons of water now.  Since the small pool loses 4 gallons/minute, the small pool has x - 4 gallons of water now.  Therefore, 4x - 16 = x - 4, so 3x = 12, and x = 4.  Therefore, the small pool has 4 - 4 = 0 gallons of water now.  The answer is 0.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to subtract the time she woke up to go to the bathroom (5 minutes) and the time she was sleepwalking (1 hour and 23 minutes) from her usual wake-up time (6 a.m.).
                 First, we need to convert 1 hour and 23 minutes into minutes. 1 hour is 60 minutes, so 1 hour and 23 minutes is 60 + 23 = 83 minutes.
                 Next, we need to subtract the time she woke up to go to the bathroom (5 minutes) and the time she was sleepwalking (83 minutes) from her usual wake-up time (6 a.m.). 6 a.m. is equivalent to 6 * 60 = 360 minutes. Subtracting 5 minutes and 83 minutes from 360 minutes, we get 360 - 5 - 83 = 272 minutes.
                 Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 272 minutes that day.<|eot_id|>

Jerome had 4 friends who came to visit him on a certain day. The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times before Jerome opened, the second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, Jerome's first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times. Jerome's second friend pressed on the doorbell 25 + (1/4 * 25) = 25 + 6.25 = 31.25 times. Jerome's third friend pressed on the doorbell 31.25 + (10 * 31.25) = 31.25 + 312.5 = 343.75 times. Jerome's fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times. Jerome's friends pressed on the doorbell a total of 20 + 25 + 31.25 + 60 + 343.75 = 460.75 times.

To determine how many shoes Jessica can buy in a year, we need to calculate how much she sets aside for shoes each month and then divide that amount by the cost of each pair of shoes.
                 Jessica makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of that amount. 25% of $2,000.00 is 0.25 x $2,000.00 = $500.00.
                 Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00. To find out how many pairs of shoes she can buy, we divide the amount she sets aside for shoes ($500.00) by the cost of each pair of shoes ($1,000.00).
                 $500.00 ÷ $1,000.00 = 0.5 pairs of shoes per month.
                 Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes she can buy per month by 12.
                 0.5 pairs of shoes per month x 12 months per year = 6 pairs of shoes per year.
                 Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of girls in the school, we need to first find the total number of students in the school. Since 40% of the school population is made up of 240 boys, we can set up the equation 0.4x = 240, where x is the total number of students in the school. Solving for x, we get x = 240 / 0.4 = 600. Therefore, the total number of students in the school is 600. To find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students: 600 - 240 = 360. Hence, there are 360 girls in the school.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much Elvis has to save for each day in the second half of the month, we first need to calculate how much he saves in the first half of the month. Since there are 15 days in the first half of the month, we can divide his monthly target by 15 to find the amount he needs to save each day in the first half.
                 $1125 ÷ 15 = $75
                 Since Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half as he does in the first half, we can multiply the amount he saves in the first half by 2 to find the amount he needs to save each day in the second half.
                 $75 × 2 = $150
                 Therefore, Elvis needs to save $150 each day in the second half of the month to hit his target.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many diapers Jordan changes per day, first calculate the total number of diapers that need to be changed.  Since there are 2 children and each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, the total number of diapers that need to be changed is 2 x 5 = 10.  Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.  To find out how many diapers Jordan changes per day, subtract the number of diapers his wife changes from the total number of diapers that need to be changed: 10 - 5 = 5.  Therefore, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.<|eot_id|>

The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 for each of the next three teeth, for a total of $1.00 * 3 = $3.00.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth.  Half of $1.00 is $0.50, so the tooth fairy gave Sharon $0.50 for each of the last 2 teeth, for a total of $0.50 * 2 = $1.00.  Therefore, the tooth fairy left Sharon a total of $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.  The answer is $9.00.<|eot_id|>

Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds, so together they weigh 4 + 3 = 7 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so it weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds.  To find the total weight, we need to add up the weights of all of her books: 4 + 7 + 6 = 17 pounds.

To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to determine how many gallons of lemonade they made. Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon and they made $25 in profit, we can start by finding out how much money they made from selling lemonade. If they sell each glass for $0.50, then for 20 glasses, they make $0.50 * 20 = $10 per gallon. If they made $25 in profit, then they must have made $25 + $10 = $35 from selling lemonade. Since each gallon costs $5 to make ($3 for lemons and $2 for sugar), we can divide $35 by $5 to find out how many gallons they made. $35 / $5 = 7 gallons. Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons, we can multiply 7 gallons by $3 to find out how much they spent on lemons. $3 * 7 = $21. Therefore, Juan and Carlos spent $21 on lemons.<|eot_id|>

To find the total cost of the two pizzas that cost the same amount, we need to subtract the cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars from the total cost of 64 dollars. The total cost of the two pizzas that cost 30 dollars is 2 x 30 = 60 dollars. Subtracting 60 dollars from 64 dollars, we get 64 - 60 = 4 dollars. Since the two pizzas that cost the same amount cost the same amount, we can divide 4 dollars by 2 to find the cost of each pizza. 4 ÷ 2 = 2 dollars. Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost 2 dollars.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total amount each of them paid for the apples.
                 Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each and received a $1 discount. First, we calculate the total cost of the apples before the discount: 20 apples * 45 cents/apple = $9. Then, we subtract the $1 discount: $9 - $1 = $8.
                 Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each and received a 10 percent discount. First, we calculate the total cost of the apples before the discount: 20 apples * 50 cents/apple = $10.

                 To find out how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts, we need to calculate 40% of the total cost of the shirts. The total cost of the shirts is 2 x $30 = $60. 40% of $60 is 0.4 x $60 = $24. So, Davos paid $60 - $24 = $36 for the 2 shirts. Therefore, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.<|eot_id|>

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we need to first find the combined length of the remoras. Since each remora is 6 inches long and there are 2 of them, the combined length of the remoras is 2 x 6 = 12 inches.
                 Next, we need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, the length of the shark in inches is 10 x 12 = 120 inches.
                 Now, we can find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras by dividing the combined length of the remoras (12 inches) by the length of the shark (120 inches) and multiplying by 100. This gives us (12/120) x 100 = 10%.

To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is, we first need to determine how many ice cubes she needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we can divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes. 65 ÷ 13 = 5. Therefore, Shannon needs 5 ice cubes to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.
Next, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we can multiply the number of ice cubes by 12. 5 x 12 = 60. Therefore, the coffee is weakened by 60 milliliters due to the ice cubes.
Finally, we need to find out how much the coffee is weakened by the 15 milliliters of cream. Since any added liquid weakens the coffee, we can simply add 15 milliliters to the weakening caused by the ice cubes. 60 + 15 = 75. Therefore, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money John had leftover after paying off his debts, we first need to calculate the amount of the loan he received. 40% of $250,000 is 0.4 x $250,000 = $100,000.  Since he used 60% of the loan to pay off his debts, we need to calculate 60% of $100,000. 60% of $100,000 is 0.6 x $100,000 = $60,000.  Therefore, John had $100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts. The answer is $40,000.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party, we first need to find out how many quarts of tea were consumed. Four students each drank 1.5 quarts of tea, so 4 x 1.5 = 6 quarts of tea were consumed by the students who drank 1.5 quarts. 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, so 16 x 2 = 32 quarts of tea were consumed by the students who drank 2 quarts. The total amount of tea consumed is 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. Since there are 10 quarts of tea left, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 10 + 38 = 48 quarts. Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, the total amount of tea at the beginning of the party is 48 / 4 = 12 gallons. Therefore, there were 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.<|eot_id|>

To determine the cost of the desk to Carmen, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spent on bidding. The bids on the desk rise by $50 each time, and she bids after each of the 3 other people. Since she wins after the 4th bid, we can calculate the cost of the desk as follows:
                 1st bid: $200
                 2nd bid: $200 + $50 = $250
                 3rd bid: $250 + $50 = $300
                 4th bid: $300 + $50 = $350
                 Since she bids after each of the 3 other people, we need to add the cost of the 4th bid to the cost of the 3 bids made by the 3 other people. The cost of the 3 bids made by the 3 other people is 3 x $50 = $150. Therefore, the total cost of the desk to Carmen is $200 + $150 + $50 = $400.
                 So, the desk costs Carmen $400.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first need to calculate how much she will save for retirement. Lauren is saving 20% of her current annual salary, which is $100,000. 20% of $100,000 is 0.20 x $100,000 = $20,000 per year. Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary, which is 0.40 x $100,000 = $40,000 per year. This means that Lauren will have $20,000 - $40,000 = -$20,000 per year. Since Lauren is saving $20,000 per year and will have -$20,000 per year, she will be in a deficit of $40,000 per year. Lauren plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years. To determine how many more years she needs to work, we need to divide the total amount she needs to save ($40,000 x 20 years = $800,000) by the amount she saves per year ($20,000). $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement. The answer is

To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we need to calculate the number of classes that visited each day and then add them together.
                 On Monday, 32 classes visited. On Tuesday, twice as many visited, so 2 * 32 = 64 classes visited. On Wednesday, three times as many visited, so 3 * 32 = 96 classes visited. On Thursday, 30 classes visited, and on Friday, 25 classes visited.
                 Now, let's add the number of classes that visited each day: 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 267.

To find out how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break it down into two parts: the first 3 hours when she runs at 10 miles per hour, and the remaining 4 hours when she runs at 5 miles per hour.
First, let's calculate the distance covered in the first 3 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours
Distance = 30 miles
Now, let's calculate the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour x 4 hours
Distance = 20 miles
To find the total distance covered in 7 hours, we add the distance covered in the first 3 hours and the distance covered in the remaining 4 hours:
Total Distance = Distance covered in first 3 hours + Distance covered in remaining 4 hours
Total Distance = 30 miles + 20 miles
Total Distance = 50 miles
Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we first need to calculate the total cost of the new rope. Since the new rope costs $1.5 a meter and is 20 meters long, the total cost of the new rope is 20 x $1.5 = $30. Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope. Since the rope costs $2 a meter and is 20 meters long, the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope is 20 x $2 = $40. To find out how much money Sarah will have left over after buying the new rope, we need to subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount of money Sarah will receive from selling the rope. So, $40 - $30 = $10. Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.<|eot_id|>

To find the perimeter of Billie's room, we first need to convert the length of the room from yards to feet. Since 1 yard is equal to 3 feet, the length of the room in feet is 3 yards * 3 feet/yard = 9 feet. Next, we need to find the width of the room. Since the area of the room is 360 square feet and the length is 9 feet, we can find the width by dividing the area by the length: 360 square feet / 9 feet = 40 feet. Now that we know the length and width of the room, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2L + 2W, where P is the perimeter, L is the length, and W is the width. Plugging in the values we know, we get P = 2(9 feet) + 2(40 feet) = 18 feet + 80 feet = 98 feet. Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's room is 98 feet.<|eot_id|>

Martha collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Martha has 3 * 35 = 105 points. The total number of points collected by the students is 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.

To calculate the total time it will take Richard to set off all the soda fountains, we need to first determine how many bottles of soda he will place along his driveway. Since the driveway is 24 feet wide and he wants to put a bottle of soda every 3 feet, we can divide 24 by 3 to find the total number of bottles.
                24 ÷ 3 = 8
                So, Richard will place 8 bottles of soda along his driveway. Since it takes him 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, we can multiply the number of bottles by the time it takes to move from one bottle to the next to find the total time.
                8 bottles × 5 seconds/bottle = 40 seconds
                Therefore, it will take Richard 40 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many students are good at math, we need to add the number of students who are good at math only and the number of students who are good at both math and English. The number of students who are good at math only is 5, and the number of students who are good at both math and English is unknown. However, we know that the total number of students in the class is 20, and the number of students who are good at English only is 8. Therefore, the number of students who are good at both math and English can be calculated by subtracting the number of students who are good at English only and the number of students who are good at math only from the total number of students. The number of students who are good at both math and English is 20 - 8 - 5 = 7. Finally, the number of students who are good at math is the sum of the number of students who are good at math only and the number of students who are good at both math and English. Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is 5 + 7 = 12. The answer is 12.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Calculate the number of birds flying overhead
To find the number of birds flying overhead, we need to calculate 2/3rd of the number of birds nesting in the bushes. The number of birds nesting in the bushes is 6. So, 2/3rd of 6 is (2/3) * 6 = 4.
## Step 2: Calculate the total number of birds feeding
There are 3 groups of eight birds each feeding. To find the total number of birds feeding, we need to multiply the number of groups by the number of birds in each group. So, 3 * 8 = 24.
## Step 3: Calculate the total number of birds
To find the total number of birds, we need to add the number of birds nesting in the bushes, the number of birds flying overhead, and the number of birds feeding. So, 6 + 4 + 24 = 34.
The final answer is: $\boxed{34}$<|eot_id|>

To find the average guess, we need to add up all the guesses and divide by the number of guesses. The first guess is 80. The second guess is 20 more than half of 80, which is (80 / 2) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60. The third guess is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100. Now we add up all the guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240. There are 3 guesses, so we divide the sum by 3: 240 / 3 = 80. The average guess is 80.<|eot_id|>

The football team played a total of 22 games. They won 8 more games than they lost. Let's say the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8. The total number of games played is the sum of the number of games won and the number of games lost, which is x + (x + 8) = 22. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 7. Therefore, the number of games they lost is 7. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is 7 + 8 = 15. The football team won 15 games.<|eot_id|>

The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$. The probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 than rolling two even numbers in a row is $\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{4}$. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100 to get $\frac{1}{4}\cdot 100=25\%$. Therefore, Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.

To determine the number of trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed and divide it by the capacity of the farm truck.
                 First, let's calculate the total weight of each type of feed:
                 - Hay: 42 bales * 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
                 - Oats: 20 sacks * 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds
                 - Carrots: 4 bags * 12 pounds/bag = 48 pounds
                 - Sugar cubes: 2 boxes * 1 pound/box = 2 pounds
                 Now, let's add up the total weight of all the feed:
                 3150 pounds (hay) + 1300 pounds (oats) + 48 pounds (carrots) + 2 pounds (sugar cubes) = 4500 pounds
                 Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we can divide the total weight of the feed by the truck's capacity to find the number of trips:
                 4500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 2 trips
                 Therefore, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.<|eot_id|>

To determine the cost of Ali's coal order, first, we need to find out how many 50 kg bags he ordered. This can be done by dividing the total weight of coal (850 kg) by the weight of each bag (50 kg).

To find the total number of coins, we add the number of silver coins to the number of gold coins. 40 + 70 = 110. Gretchen had 110 coins in total.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we need to multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row, and then multiply that result by the fraction of flowers that have bloomed.
                 First, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row: 10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers.
                 Then, we multiply that result by the fraction of flowers that have bloomed: 200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers.
                 Therefore, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.<|eot_id|>

To find the total commission earned by Cayley, we need to calculate the commission earned from each newspaper and then add them together.
                 Commission from New York Times: 6 copies * 10% * $5 = 6 * 0.1 * 5 = $3
                 Commission from Wall Street Journal: 10 copies * 8% * $15 = 10 * 0.08 * 15 = $12
                 Total commission: $3 + $12 = $15

To find out how many fruits George has, we first need to determine how many pears he has. Since George has 45% more pears than bananas, we can calculate the number of pears by multiplying the number of bananas by 1.45 (which is equivalent to 100% + 45%).
                 pears = bananas * 1.45
                 pears = 200 * 1.45
                 pears = 290
                 Now that we know George has 290 pears, we can find the total number of fruits by adding the number of bananas and pears.
                 total_fruits = bananas + pears
                 total_fruits = 200 + 290
                 total_fruits = 490

To find out how many hours Jim spends on TV and reading in 4 weeks, we need to first find out how many hours he spends on TV and reading in one week.
                 In one week, Jim spends 2 hours watching TV.  He reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2 / 2 = 1 hour.  In total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on TV and reading in one week.
                 Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours on TV and reading in one week.
                 In 4 weeks, he spends 9 * 4 = 36 hours on TV and reading.

To determine how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package, we need to calculate the total cost of his new streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.
First, let's calculate the cost of Netflix, which is $10 a month.
Next, we need to calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus. Since they normally cost $10 a month each, but Tim saves 20% for bundling, we need to calculate 20% of $10 and subtract it from the total cost. 20% of $10 is $2, so the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus will be $10 - $2 = $8 a month.
Now, let's calculate the total cost of his new streaming services. The cost of Netflix is $10, and the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $8, so the total cost is $10 + $8 = $18 a month.
To find out how much money Tim saves by cancelling his cable package, we need to subtract the total cost of his new streaming services from the cost of the cable package. The cost of the cable package is $60, and the total cost of his new streaming services is $18, so he saves $60 - $18 = $42

Next, let's calculate the amount of money he made from selling the remaining sneakers to the department store. There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left, and he sold them for $25 each. So, he made 31 x $25 = $775 from the department store sales.
Now, let's add the money he made from the flash sale and the department store sales: $340 + $775 = $1115.

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach. The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each, so the total amount spent by the baseball coach is 9 x $3 = $27. The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each, so the total amount spent by the basketball coach is 8 x $14 = $112. To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to subtract the amount spent by the baseball coach from the amount spent by the basketball coach: $112 - $27 = $85. Therefore, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.<|eot_id|>

To find the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia, we need to add the highest temperatures of each country and then divide by the number of countries, which is 3.
                 The highest temperature of Southlandia is -48 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature of Northlandia is 21 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest temperature of Midlandia is -3 degrees Fahrenheit.
                 Adding these temperatures together, we get -48 + 21 - 3 = -30 degrees Fahrenheit.
                 Dividing -30 by 3, we get -10 degrees Fahrenheit.
                 Therefore, the average highest temperature of Southlandia, Northlandia, and Midlandia is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank, we need to calculate the total amount of money she spends on lollipops in 5 days and subtract that from the total amount of money she gets as pocket money in 5 days.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of money Marisa spends on lollipops in 5 days. She buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. So, the total amount of money she spends on lollipops in 1 day is 4 x 25 cents = 1 dollar. In 5 days, she spends 5 x 1 dollar = 5 dollars.
                 Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Marisa gets as pocket money in 5 days. She gets $5 every day, so in 5 days, she gets 5 x 5 dollars = 25 dollars.
                 To find out how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank, we subtract the total amount of money she spends on lollipops from the total amount of money she gets as pocket money. So, 25 dollars - 5 dollars = 20 dollars.

To find out how many elves are left, we need to start with the total number of elves hired, which is 60. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find a third of 60, we multiply 60 by 1/3, which is the same as dividing 60 by 3. 60 ÷ 3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them, leaving 60 - 20 = 40 elves. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. To find out how many elves are left, we need to subtract 10 from 40. 40 - 10 = 30. So, there are 30 elves left. The answer is 30.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week, we need to calculate the number of hours she slept each day and then add them up.
                 On Monday, Sadie slept 8 hours.
                 On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, so she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
                 On Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Tuesday, so she slept 6 - 2 = 4 hours.
                 On Thursday, she slept 1 hour more than Wednesday, so she slept 4 + 1 = 5 hours.

To find the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then add them together.
First, we know that one red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, the total value of the red cars is 5 x $4 = $20.
Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since one action figure costs $5, 3 action figures cost 3 x $5 = $15. Therefore, the doll also costs $15.
The total value of the action figures is 3 x $5 = $15.
Now, we can add up the values of all the toys to find the total value: $20 (red cars) + $15 (doll) + $15 (action figures) = $50.
Therefore, all the toys are worth $50.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to calculate the number of wolves and cougars he killed each day and then add them together.
First, we know that Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars last night. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, which means he killed 3 * 15 = 45 wolves. He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, which means he killed 15 - 3 = 12 cougars.
To find the total number of animals Rick killed, we need to add the number of wolves and cougars he killed each day. The total number of wolves he killed is 10 + 45 = 55. The total number of cougars he killed is 15 + 12 = 27.

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit each year. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. The total revenue is the number of lemons sold multiplied by the price of each lemon. The total cost is the cost to plant the tree plus the cost to water and feed the tree.
                 Year 1:
                 Total Revenue: 7 lemons * $1.5 = $10.50
                 Total Cost: $90 (initial cost) + $3 (water and feed) = $93
                 Net Profit: $10.50 - $93 = -$82.50
                 Year 2:

To find the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the initial charge of the power bank as 'x'. Since the power bank loses 9% of the total capacity each hour for the first 5 hours, we can calculate the remaining charge after 5 hours as follows:
                 x - (9% of x) * 5 = x - 0.09x * 5 = x - 0.45x = 0.55x
                 So, the charge remaining after 5 hours is 0.55x.
                 For the next 3 hours, the power bank loses 7% of the total capacity each hour, so we can calculate the remaining charge after 3 hours as follows:
                 0.55x - (7% of 0.55x) * 3 = 0.55x - 0.055x * 3 = 0.55x - 0.165x = 0.385x
                 Since the charge remaining after 8 hours is 28%, we can set up the equation as follows:
                 0.385x = 0.28

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices, we need to first find the new price of each computer. The original price was $700, but the price increased by 10%. To find the new price, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price.

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up the total number of birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days.
                 First, let's add up the total number of birds Mack saw over the week. On days one and two, he saw 50 birds. On day three, he saw 0 birds. On days four and five, he saw 120 birds. On day six, he saw 20 birds. On day seven, he saw 90 birds.
                 The total number of birds Mack saw over the week is 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280.
                 To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to divide the total number of birds by the number of days. There are 7 days in a week.
                 The average number of birds Mack saw in a day is 280 ÷ 7 = 40.
                 Therefore, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day over the week.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total ounces of meat consumed by the team, we need to calculate the ounces of meat consumed by each player and then add them together.
                 The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
                 The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, so the total ounces of meat consumed by the second player is 8 ounces.
                 The third player ate a one-pound steak, which is equivalent to 16 ounces.
                 The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they did not consume any meat.
                 Now, let's add up the ounces of meat consumed by each player:
                 6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces
                 Therefore, the total ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30 ounces.<|eot_id|>

Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Adam is currently 40 inches tall, so he needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 inches. Since Adam grows 2 inches a year, we can divide 8 by 2 to find out how many years it will take him to grow 8 inches. 8 ÷ 2 = 4. Therefore, it will take Adam 4 years to be tall enough to ride the roller coaster.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling the devices and subtract the total amount of money he spent on buying the devices.
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Linus spent on buying the devices. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday, so the total number of devices he bought is 2 + 4 = 6. Since each device costs $20, the total amount of money he spent on buying the devices is 6 x $20 = $120.
Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Linus earned from selling the devices. He sells each device for twice the amount of the original price, so he sells each device for 2 x $20 = $40. Since he sold 6 devices, the total amount of money he earned from selling the devices is 6 x $40 = $240.
Now, let's calculate the profit Linus was able to earn after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday. To do this, we subtract the total amount of money he spent on buying the devices from the total amount of money he

To find the total cost of Charlotte's order, we need to first calculate the total cost of the items before the discount.  The set of pot and pans is $120.00, the set of mixing bowls is $20.00, and the 5 separate utensils are 5 x $5.00 = $25.00.  The total cost of the items before the discount is $120.00 + $20.00 + $25.00 = $165.00.  Since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of $165.00.  20% of $165.00 is 0.20 x $165.00 = $33.00.  To find the total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount, we need to subtract $33.00 from the total cost of the items before the discount.  The total cost of Charlotte's order after the discount is $165.00 - $33.00 = $132.00.  Therefore, the total cost of Charlotte's order is $132.00.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pints of gasoline Josey needed, we first need to find out how many gallons were in one container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, we can divide 15 by 5 to find out how many gallons were in one container. 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons. Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, we can multiply 3 gallons by 8 pints to find out how many pints were in one container. 3 x 8 = 24 pints. Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, we can multiply 24 pints by 1/4 to find out how many pints Josey needed. 24 x 1/4 = 24 x 0.25 = 6 pints. Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much change Michael has after buying the hay, we need to calculate the total cost of the hay first. Since the horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, we need to convert the time to hours. 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours. The distance the horse runs in 0.5 hours is 32 * 0.5 = 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile it runs, it will eat 16 * 0.5 = 8 bails of hay. A bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is 8 * 3 = $24. Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is equal to 6 * 5 = $30. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the hay from the total amount of money Michael has: $30 - $24 = $6. Therefore, Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we first need to calculate the total amount of flour and milk needed for the quadruple batch of brownies.

Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, Mark will need to buy 12 / 2 = 6 bags of flour. Similarly, since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, Mark will need to buy 4 / 2 = 2 bottles of milk. To find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 - 2 = 4.

To find out how many plums Jamaar can buy, we first need to calculate how much money he has left after purchasing the fruits he already bought. The cost of 3 peaches is 3 x $0.5 = $1.5. The cost of 4 pears is 4 x $0.5 = $2. The cost of 2 kiwis is 2 x $1 = $2. The cost of 5 apples is 5 x $0.75 = $3.75. The total cost of these fruits is $1.5 + $2 + $2 + $3.75 = $9.25. Jamaar started with $10, so he has $10 - $9.25 = $0.75 left. Since each plum costs $0.25, we can divide $0.75 by $0.25 to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy. $0.75 ÷ $0.25 = 3. Therefore, Jamaar can buy 3 plums.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pieces of sweets each of Anne's friends received, we first need to calculate the total number of sweets in the box. Since there are 15 packs, and each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets is 15 * 60 = 900 pieces.
                 Next, we need to find out how many sweets were given to Anne's friends. Since she kept 2 packs, the number of packs given to her friends is 15 - 2 = 13 packs.
                 Since each pack has 60 pieces, the total number of sweets given to her friends is 13 * 60 = 780 pieces.
                 To find out how many pieces of sweets each of her friends received, we need to divide the total number of sweets given to her friends by the number of friends. Since there are 10 friends, each friend received 780 / 10 = 78 pieces of sweets.

To find the total cost of postage for Anthony's coupons, we need to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons and the big coupons separately, then add them together.
First, let's calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons, and each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. To find the total cost of mailing the small coupons, we multiply the number of small coupons by the cost per small coupon:
700 small coupons * 5 cents = 3500 cents
Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert the total cost from cents to dollars by dividing by 100:
3500 cents / 100 = $35
Next, let's calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. Anthony is sending out twice as many big coupons as small coupons, so he is sending out 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons. Each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. To find the total cost of mailing the big coupons, we multiply the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon:
1400 big coupons * 15 cents = 21000 cents
Again, we can convert the total cost from cents to dollars by dividing by 100:

To calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, we need to calculate the cost of the picture frames, the cost of the etching, the cost of the pins, the cost of the cords for the officers, and then add them all together.
                 The cost of the picture frames is 44 x $20 = $880.
                 The cost of the etching is 20% of $880, which is 0.20 x $880 = $176.
                 The total cost of the picture frames and etching is $880 + $176 = $1056.
                 The cost of the pins is 2 x $5 = $10.
                 The number of officers is 1/4 of 44, which is 44 / 4 = 11.  The cost of the cords for the officers is 11 x $12 = $132.
                 The total cost of the senior gifts is $1056 + $10 + $132 = $1198.

To find out how much money Kelly has left in her budget, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items in her cart and subtract that amount from her total budget of $65.
First, let's calculate the total cost of the bacon. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, the cost of one pack of bacon is $10 / 5 = $2.
Next, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken. Since each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon, the cost of one packet of chicken is $2 x 2 = $4. Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is $4 x 6 = $24.
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the strawberries. Since each pack of strawberries costs $4 and Kelly has 3 packs, the total cost of the strawberries is $4 x 3 = $12.
Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the apples. Since each pack of apples costs half the price of a pack of strawberries, the cost of one pack of apples is $4 / 2 = $2. Since Kelly has 7 packs of apples, the total cost of the apples is $2 x

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours. Since the air conditioner cools the room 2 degrees an hour on low, it cooled the room 3 * 2 = 6 degrees in 3 hours. Therefore, the room was 6 degrees cooler than the starting temperature after the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours.
                 Next, the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours. Since the air conditioner cools the room 3 degrees an hour on high, it cooled the room 4 * 3 = 12 degrees in 4 hours. Therefore, the room was 12 degrees cooler than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned up to high for 4 hours.
                 Finally, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours. Since the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running, the room warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees in 2 hours. Therefore, the room was 4 degrees warmer than the starting temperature after the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.

To determine how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish, we need to calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings and compare it to the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.
                 First, let's calculate the time it would take for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 12 minutes for the new varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 12 * 6 = 72 minutes for the new varnish to dry on 6 paintings.
                 Next, let's calculate the time it would take for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings. Since it takes 7 minutes for the old varnish to dry on one painting, it will take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes for the old varnish to dry on 6 paintings.
                 To find out how much longer it will take for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish, we need to subtract the time it would take for the old varnish to dry from

To determine how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we first need to find out how many regular chairs she has. Since the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, we can multiply the number of high chairs by 5 to find the number of regular chairs.
                 8 high chairs * 5 = 40 regular chairs
                 Next, we need to add the number of high chairs and regular chairs together to find the total number of chairs.
                 8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs
                 Since there will be 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function, we need to add the number of adults and babies together to find the total number of people.
                 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people
                 To find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get, we subtract the total number of chairs from the total number of people.
                 57 people - 48 chairs = 9 more chairs

To find out how much money Suzanne has left, we need to calculate her total earnings first. She sold 80 cookies for $1 each, so her earnings from cookies are 80 x $1 = $80. She also sold 60 cupcakes for $4 each, so her earnings from cupcakes are 60 x $4 = $240. Her total earnings are $80 + $240 = $320. Suzanne gave her two sisters $10 each, so she gave them a total of 2 x $10 = $20. To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract the amount she gave her sisters from her total earnings: $320 - $20 = $300. Therefore, Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.<|eot_id|>

To determine the distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to break down the journey into two parts: the westward journey and the northward journey.
                 For the westward journey, both trains travel for 80 miles. Since they are traveling at the same time and in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 80 miles.
                 For the northward journey, both trains travel for 150 miles. Again, since they are traveling at the same time and in the same direction, the distance covered by each train is the same, which is 150 miles.
                 To find the total distance covered by each train in the two days, we need to add the distances covered in the westward and northward journeys. The total distance covered by each train is 80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northward) = 230 miles.

To determine how far off Tim's guess was from the true number of red jelly beans in the jar, we must first calculate the total number of jelly beans in the jar.  The jar is 6 inches by 6 inches and 15 inches tall, so the volume of the jar is 6 * 6 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.  Since a jelly bean is.15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 540 /.15 = 3600 jelly beans.  Since the jelly beans get about 80% efficiency in packing, the actual number of jelly beans in the jar is 3600 /.8 = 4500 jelly beans.  Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans in the jar is 4500 *.3 = 1350 jelly beans.  Since the true number of red jelly beans in the jar is 900, Tim's guess was 1350 - 900 = 450 jelly beans off.  Therefore, Tim's guess was 450 jelly beans off from the true number of red jelly beans in the jar.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Calculate the number of students per group
To find the number of students per group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups. total_students = 54, number_of_groups = 6. students_per_group = total_students / number_of_groups = 54 / 6 = 9.
## Step 2: Calculate the number of groups needed for 54 students
To find the number of groups needed for 54 students, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per group. students_per_group = 9, total_students = 54. number_of_groups_needed = total_students / students_per_group = 54 / 9 = 6.
## Step 3: Calculate the additional number of groups needed
To find the additional number of groups needed, we subtract the current number of groups from the required number of groups. required_groups = 12, current_groups = 6. additional_groups_needed = required_groups - current_groups = 12 - 6 = 6.

To determine the total cost of Karen's manicure and pedicure with nail art, first calculate the cost of the basic manicure and pedicure. The basic manicure costs $35 and the basic pedicure costs $40. The total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure is $35 + $40 = $75. Next, calculate the 20% discount on the total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure. The discount is 20% of $75, which is 0.20 * $75 = $15. Subtract the discount from the total cost of the basic manicure and pedicure to get the discounted price. The discounted price is $75 - $15 = $60. Finally, calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers in total. The cost of the nail art is $3 per nail, so the total cost of the nail art is $3 * 10 = $30. Add the cost of the nail art to the discounted price of the manicure and pedicure to get the total cost. The total cost is $60 + $30 = $90. Therefore, Karen would pay $90 in

To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we first need to determine the total number of riders who can stay upright. Since 25% of the riders can stay upright when the wave is over 30 feet, we can calculate this number by multiplying the total number of riders (100) by 25% (or 0.25).
                 100 x 0.25 = 25
                 Since 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, we can calculate the number of women who can stay upright by multiplying the number of riders who can stay upright (25) by 60% (or 0.6).
                 25 x 0.6 = 15
                 To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who can stay upright (15) from the total number of riders who can stay upright (25).
                 25 - 15 = 10
                 Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them, we need to calculate the total amount of money they spent on the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream.
                 First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons. They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is equal to 12 balloons. Since each balloon costs $0.5, the total cost of the balloons is 12 x $0.5 = $6.
                 Next, let's calculate the cost of the ice cream. They bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so the total cost of the ice cream is 2 x $7 = $14.
                 Now, let's add up the cost of the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream. The total cost is $11 + $6 + $14 = $31.
                 Since Julia and Nadine's mother gave them the same amount of allowance, we can divide the total cost by 2 to find out how much she gave each one of them. $31 ÷ 2 = $15.5.
                 Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $15.50.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we first need to find out how much laundry each of them does. We know that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide 400 by 4 to find out how much laundry David does. 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide 400 by 2 to find out how much laundry Raymond does. 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. Now that we know how much laundry each of them does, we can find the difference by subtracting the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does. 200 - 100 = 100 pounds. Therefore, Raymond does 100 pounds more laundry than David.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much water the boat had taken on by the time Julia reached shore, we need to calculate the total distance she rowed and the total time it took her to row that distance. Since the boat was taking on two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the total distance rowed by 0.2 liters per ten feet.
First, we need to calculate the total distance Julia rowed. We know that it took her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. To find the distance she rowed per second, we can divide 20 feet by 16 seconds, which gives us 1.25 feet per second. Since the shore was 64 seconds away, we can multiply 1.25 feet per second by 64 seconds to find the total distance rowed, which is 80 feet.
Next, we can calculate the total amount of water taken on by multiplying the total distance rowed (80 feet) by 0.2 liters per ten feet. This gives us 80 x 0.2 = 16 liters.
Therefore, the boat had taken on 16 liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of messages James delivers, first calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, he delivers 1/3 * 66 = 22 messages to Mr. Yu. Then, add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson (66) and Mr. Yu (22) to find the total number of messages delivered. The total number of messages delivered is 66 + 22 = 88. Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of chimichangas the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, we need to add the number of chimichangas they make on each day.
                 On Tuesdays, they make 125 chimichangas. On Wednesdays, they also make 125 chimichangas.
                 On Fridays, they make twice as many chimichangas as they do on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Since they make 125 chimichangas on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas on Fridays.
                 To find the total number of chimichangas, we need to add 125 + 125 + 250.
                 125 + 125 = 250.

To determine how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we need to calculate the difference in income between doing the taxes herself and hiring the accountant.
First, let's calculate the lost income if Jackie does the taxes herself. She'll lose 3 hours of freelance work at $35/hour, so the lost income is 3 x $35 = $105.
Next, let's calculate the cost of hiring the accountant. The accountant charges $90.
To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant, we subtract the cost of hiring the accountant from the lost income: $105 - $90 = $15.
Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many minutes early Toby will be, we first need to calculate the total number of words in the book. Since the book is 45 pages long and averages 200 words per page, the total number of words in the book is 45 * 200 = 9000 words. Since Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute, the time it will take him to finish the book is 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes. Toby has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and it takes him 10 minutes to get there, so he will arrive at the airport 60 - 10 = 50 minutes after he finishes the book. Since it will take him 30 minutes to finish the book, he will arrive 50 - 30 = 20 minutes early. The answer is 20.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of blue jelly beans in the jar.  Let x be the number of blue jelly beans.  Since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.  Since the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.  We know that the total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4500, so we can set up the equation x + 0.99x + 1.01x = 4500.  Combining like terms, we get 3.00x = 4500.  Solving for x, we get x = 1500.  Therefore, the number of blue jelly beans is 1500.  The number of red jelly beans is 0.99x = 0.99(1500) = 1485.  The number of green jelly beans is 1.01x = 1.01(1500) = 1515.  Therefore, the jar contains 1515 - 1485 = 30 more green jelly beans than red

To find the total cost of Aleksandra's dinner, we need to calculate the cost of each item and add them together. The bagel costs $4. The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, which is $4 + (25% of $4) = $4 + $1 = $5. The cake costs half of the price of the bagel, which is $4 / 2 = $2. To find the total cost, we add the cost of the bagel ($4), the cost of the soup ($5), and the cost of the cake ($2). The total cost is $4 + $5 + $2 = $11. Aleksandra needs to pay $11 for her dinner.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we need to subtract the number of people kicked out for shoplifting, physical violence, and mask refusal from the total number of people kicked out.
                 First, we need to find the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. We know that 4 times the number of people kicked out for mask refusal equals the number of people kicked out for shoplifting. Since 3 people were kicked out for mask refusal, 4 * 3 = 12 people were kicked out for shoplifting.
                 Next, we need to find the number of people kicked out for physical violence. We know that 3 times the number of people kicked out for shoplifting equals the number of people kicked out for physical violence. Since 12 people were kicked out for shoplifting, 3 * 12 = 36 people were kicked out for physical violence.
                 Now, we can find the number of people kicked out for other reasons by subtracting the number of people kicked out for mask refusal, shoplifting, and physical violence from the total number of people kicked out. 50 - 3 - 12 - 36 = 50 - 51 = -1.

To determine how many packs of glue sticks Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of students (27) by the number of glue sticks each student will receive (2). This gives us 27 ÷ 2 = 13.5. Since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure every student gets 2 glue sticks. Therefore, Mr. Jackson will need to buy at least 14 packs of glue sticks. To find out how many extra glue sticks he will have, we multiply the number of packs he buys (14) by the number of glue sticks in each pack (8). This gives us 14 × 8 = 112 extra glue sticks. So, Mr. Jackson will need to buy 14 packs of glue sticks to give each of his 27 students 2 glue sticks, and he will have 112 extra glue sticks.<|eot_id|>

To find the age of Bill when he saw the comet for the first time, we need to first find the age of his dad when he saw the comet for the second time. We know that Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet for the second time. Let's call the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time "x". Since Bill saw the comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet for the second time, we can say that Bill was 3x years old when he saw the comet for the second time. We know that the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, so we can set up an equation to find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the comet for the second time. Since Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old, and the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, we can say that 30 + 75n = x, where n is the number of times the comet has orbited the sun since Bill's dad saw the comet for the second time.

To find out how many points Amy scores, we need to calculate the number of correct answers for each type of question and then multiply by the point value for each type of question.
First, let's calculate the number of correct answers for the multiple-choice questions:
80% of 10 questions = 0.8 x 10 = 8 correct answers
Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, we multiply the number of correct answers by the point value:
8 correct answers x 1 point = 8 points
Next, let's calculate the number of correct answers for the true/false questions:
90% of 20 questions = 0.9 x 20 = 18 correct answers
Since each true/false question is worth 1 point, we multiply the number of correct answers by the point value:
18 correct answers x 1 point = 18 points
Finally, let's calculate the number of correct answers for the long-answer questions:
60% of 5 questions = 0.6 x 5 = 3 correct answers
Since each long-answer question is worth 5 points, we multiply the number of correct answers by the point value:

To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to first calculate the total cost of the cell phones. Since she bought five cell phones for $150 each, the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.
                 Next, we need to calculate the interest charged for each unit. A 2% interest will be charged for each unit, so the interest for each unit is 2% of $150, which is 0.02 x $150 = $3.
                 Since there are five units, the total interest charged will be 5 x $3 = $15.
                 To find out how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to divide the total cost and total interest by 3. The total cost is $750 and the total interest is $15, so the monthly payment will be ($750 + $15) / 3 = $262.50.

To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car from 2007 to 2010. Since the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year, we can use the formula for exponential decay:
                 P(t) = P0 * (1 - r)^t
                 where P(t) is the price of the car at time t, P0 is the initial price of the car, r is the depreciation rate, and t is the number of years.
                 In this case, P0 = $20000, r = 0.21, and t = 3 (since 2010 is 3 years after 2007).
                 Plugging in the values, we get:
                 P(3) = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3
                 P(3) = $20000 * (0.79)^3
                 P(3) = $20000 * 0.531441
                 P(3) = $10628.82
                 Therefore, the price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately $10628.82.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pencils were left at the end of the year, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils in the class at the beginning of the year.
Total pencils = Number of students * Pencils per student
Total pencils = 30 * 10
Total pencils = 300
Step 2: Calculate the number of pencils used after two months.
Pencils used = Total pencils * 1/5
Pencils used = 300 * 1/5
Pencils used = 60
Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months.
Pencils remaining = Total pencils - Pencils used
Pencils remaining = 300 - 60
Pencils remaining = 240
Step 4: Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year.
Pencils left = Pencils remaining * 1/3
Pencils left = 240 * 1/3
Pencils left = 80

To determine how far Elvis is from his house now, we need to calculate the total distance he has traveled. Since he traveled west for 5 hours and east for 8 hours, we need to calculate the distance for each part of the journey and then add them together.
                 Distance = Speed x Time
                 For the first part of the journey (west), the distance traveled is:
                 Distance = 18mph x 5 hours
                 Distance = 90 miles
                 For the second part of the journey (east), the distance traveled is:
                 Distance = 18mph x 8 hours
                 Distance = 144 miles
                 The total distance traveled is the sum of the distances traveled in each part of the journey:
                 Total Distance = 90 miles + 144 miles
                 Total Distance = 234 miles
                 Since Elvis traveled 234 miles west and then 144 miles east, we need to subtract the distance traveled east from the distance traveled west to find the distance from his house:
                 Distance from house = 234 miles - 144 miles
                 Distance from house = 90 miles

To find the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to add the number of geraniums to the number of petunias. Since he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, he plants 90 - 40 = 50 petunias. The total number of flowers is 90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias) = 140 flowers. Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many cents Grayson earns from recycling in a four-week month, we need to calculate her earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate her earnings from aluminum cans. She drinks three aluminum cans a week, and each can is worth two cents. So, her weekly earnings from aluminum cans are 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.
                 Next, let's calculate her earnings from plastic bottles. She drinks five plastic bottles a week, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, her weekly earnings from plastic bottles are 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.
                 Now, let's add her weekly earnings from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to find her total weekly earnings. Her total weekly earnings are 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents.
                 Since there are four weeks in a month, we need to multiply her total weekly earnings by 4 to find her total monthly earnings. Her total monthly earnings are 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents.
                 Therefore, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days, we need to calculate the total number of eggs he will eat in 60 days.
                 In the first 30 days, Chester eats 3 eggs a day, so he will eat 3 * 30 = 90 eggs.
                 In the next 30 days, Chester eats 5 eggs a day, so he will eat 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.
                 The total number of eggs Chester will eat in 60 days is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.
                 Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester will need.
                 240 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 20 dozens of eggs.

First, we need to find out how much money he earned from doing his chores. Since he did his chores for 3 weeks and his allowance is $6 each week, he earned 3 x $6 = $18. Next, we need to find out how much money he spent on the ice cream cones. Since he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1.25 each, he spent 1 x $1.25 + 3 x $1.25 = $1.25 + $3.75 = $5.00 on the ice cream cones. Now, we need to subtract the money he spent on the ice cream cones from the money he earned from doing his chores. $18 - $5.00 = $13.00. Finally, we need to find out how many movie tickets he can buy with $13.00. Since each movie ticket costs $6.50, we can divide $13.00 by $6.50 to find out how many tickets he can buy. $13.00 ÷ $6.50 = 2.00. Since

To determine how many pounds of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing required for each type of bed and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the amount of stuffing needed for the 4 chihuahua beds. Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing, so 4 chihuahua beds will require 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.
                 Next, let's calculate the amount of stuffing needed for the 3 collie beds. A collie bed takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. Since a Rottweiler bed takes 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing, the average is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing per collie bed. Therefore, 3 collie beds will require 3 x 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.
                 Finally, we add the amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds to get the total amount of stuffing needed: 8 + 15 = 23

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and add it to the number of carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday.
First, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays. There are 5 weekdays, and he eats 4 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 5 x 4 = 20.
Next, let's calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on Saturday and Sunday. He eats 5 carrots each day, and there are 2 days. So, the total number of carrots he eats on Saturday and Sunday is 2 x 5 = 10.
Now, let's add the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays and Saturday and Sunday. The total number of carrots he eats in a week is 20 + 10 = 30.
Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much profit Sasha makes, we need to calculate the total cost of the lumber and the total selling price of the lumber. First, let's calculate the total cost of the lumber. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each, so the total cost of these boards is 10 x $10 = $100. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $16 each, so the total cost of these boards is 5 x $16 = $80. The total cost of the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180. Next, let's calculate the total selling price of the lumber. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that she can sell for $15 each, so the total selling price of these boards is 10 x $15 = $150. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she can sell for $20 each, so the total selling price of these boards is 5 x $20 = $100. The total selling price of the lumber is $150 + $100 = $250. To find the profit, we subtract the total cost of the lumber from the total selling price

To find out how many years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age, we first need to determine her present age. Since Melanie will be 18 years old in 10 years, we can calculate her present age by subtracting 10 from 18.
                 Melanie's present age = 18 - 10
                 Melanie's present age = 8
                 Now that we know Melanie's present age is 8, we can find out how many years it will take for her age to be thrice her present age.
                 Let x be the number of years it will take for Melanie's age to be thrice her present age.
                 Melanie's age in x years = 8 + x
                 3 * Melanie's present age = 8 + x
                 3 * 8 = 8 + x
                 24 = 8 + x
                 24 - 8 = x
                 x = 16

To find the total cost of the party, first calculate the number of additional guests beyond the initial 20.

However, 4 people said they could not come, so the total number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41. Since 20 guests are already included in the initial fee, the number of additional guests is 41 - 20 = 21. The cost for these additional guests is 21 x $6 = $126. Adding this to the initial fee of $125, the total cost of the party is $125 + $126 = $251. Therefore, the party will cost $251.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many gallons of water are remaining for the tank to be full, we need to calculate the total amount of water that Wanda and Ms. B pumped into the tank over the two days.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is (2/3) * 4500 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is (1/3) * 3375 = 1125 gallons. The total amount of water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.

To find the length of one of Bobby's shoes, first convert the length of one of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to just inches.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches.  Adding the 4 inches, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.  Since the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes, set up the equation 9b + 10 = 100, where b is the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get 9b = 90.  Divide both sides of the equation by 9 to get b = 10.  Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.<|eot_id|>

Let's denote my brother's age as B, my sister's age as S, and my age as A. Since I am three years younger than my brother, A = B - 3. Since I am 2 years older than my sister, A = S + 2. Since my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, my mom's age is 3B - 1. The sum of our ages is 87, so A + B + S + (3B - 1) = 87. Substituting A = B - 3 and A = S + 2 into the equation, we get (B - 3) + B + (S + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87. Combining like terms, we get 5B + S - 2 = 87. Adding 2 to both sides, we get 5B + S = 89.

To determine how many individual brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to calculate the total number of brownies she received and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.
                 First, let's calculate the total number of brownies Greta received.  She made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies for herself.  At her office party, she received 1/2 a dozen brownies.  At her surprise party at home, she received 4 dozen brownies.  So, the total number of brownies she received is 1 + 0.5 + 4 = 5.5 dozen.
                 Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 individual brownies, we can convert 5.5 dozen to individual brownies by multiplying 5.5 by 12.  5.5 * 12 = 66 individual brownies.
                 Next, we need to subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  We can convert 1 1/2 dozen to individual brownies by multiplying 1.5 by 12.  1.5 * 12 = 18

To find out how much 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo, we first need to calculate the cost of 10 lollipops. Since each lollipop costs $0.40, 10 lollipops will cost 10 x $0.40 = $4.00. Next, we need to calculate the cost of 10 candies. Manolo bought four candies that cost $3.20, so the cost of one candy is $3.20 / 4 = $0.80. Therefore, 10 candies will cost 10 x $0.80 = $8.00. To find the total cost, we add the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, which is $4.00 + $8.00 = $12.00. Therefore, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost Manolo $12.00.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Derrick makes in June, we need to calculate the total number of doughnuts he sells in the month. June has 30 days, so Derrick sells 10 dozen doughnuts per day for 30 days. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12 doughnuts, Derrick sells 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts per day. In 30 days, he sells 120 x 30 = 3600 doughnuts. Since each doughnut is sold for $2, Derrick makes 3600 x $2 = $7200 in June. Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling his lego sets. He sold 13 lego sets for $15 each, so he made 13 x $15 = $195. Then, we need to calculate how much money he spent on video games. He bought 8 video games for $20 each, so he spent 8 x $20 = $160. Since he had $5 left after buying the video games, we know that he had $195 - $160 - $5 = $30 left after buying the video games. Since he had $30 left after buying the video games, we know that he had $195 - $30 = $165 before buying the video games. Since he had $165 before buying the video games, we know that he had $165 / $15 = 11 lego sets before buying the video games. Since he had 11 lego sets before buying the video games, we know that he still has 13 - 11 = 2 lego sets. The answer is 2.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to calculate the number of pages she read in the first week and add it to the number of pages she read in the second week.
                 In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night. Since she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, we can calculate the number of pages she read in the first week as follows:
                 15 minutes / 1.5 minutes per page = 10 pages per night
                 Since there are 7 nights in a week, the total number of pages Judy read in the first week is:
                 10 pages per night * 7 nights = 70 pages
                 In the second week, Judy read a total of 100 pages.
                 To find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the number of pages she read in the first week to the number of pages she read in the second week:
                 70 pages + 100 pages = 170 pages

To find the number of votes the loser got, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner got. Since the winner got 3/4 of the votes, we can multiply the total number of students who voted (80) by 3/4.

To find out how many cycles you can run with the new box for $1, we first need to determine how many pods are in the new box. Since the new box has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods in the new box by multiplying the number of pods in the regular box (100) by 1.2 (which represents 100% + 20% = 120%, or 20% more).
                 100 * 1.2 = 120
                 So, the new box has 120 pods. Since you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 120 cycles with the new box.
                 To find out how many cycles you can run for $1, we need to divide $1 by the cost of the new box, which is $12.
                 1 ÷ 12 = 0.0833
                 Since you can't run a fraction of a cycle, we round down to the nearest whole number.
                 0.0833 → 0

To solve this problem, let's break it down day by day.
Day 1: There are 10 people infected initially. Each infected person infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 10 * 6 = 60. Therefore, the total number of people infected at the end of Day 1 is 10 (initially infected) + 60 (newly infected) = 70.
Day 2: At the end of Day 1, there are 70 people infected. Each infected person infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 70 * 6 = 420. Therefore, the total number of people infected at the end of Day 2 is 70 (initially infected) + 420 (newly infected) = 490.
Day 3: At the end of Day 2, there are 490 people infected. Each infected person infects 6 others, so the total number of new infections is 490 * 6 = 2940. Therefore, the total number of people infected at the end of Day 3 is 490 (initially infected) + 2940 (newly infected) = 3430.

To find Rose's profit, we need to calculate the total cost of the eggs and the total amount of money she will make from selling them. First, we need to find the total cost of the eggs. Since Rose bought five dozens of eggs and each dozen costs $2.40, the total cost of the eggs is 5 x $2.40 = $12.00. Next, we need to find the total amount of money Rose will make from selling the eggs. Since she will sell the eggs for $1 for 3 eggs, the total amount of money she will make from selling the eggs is (5 x 3) x $1 = $15.00. To find Rose's profit, we need to subtract the total cost of the eggs from the total amount of money she will make from selling the eggs. Rose's profit is $15.00 - $12.00 = $3.00. Therefore, Rose's profit is $3.00.<|eot_id|>

To find the distance between the two trains after 3 hours, we need to calculate the distance each train has traveled. The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. The second train is traveling at half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles. Since they are traveling in opposite directions, we need to add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them. Therefore, the distance between the two trains after 3 hours is 180 + 90 = 270 miles.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and subtract that from the total hours required to earn the achievement.
                 Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, 2 weeks is equal to 14 days. Therefore, Kris has played 14 x 0.5 = 7 hours in the first 2 weeks.
                 Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Kris has played 7 x 2 = 14 hours in the last week.
                 The total hours Kris has already played is 7 + 14 = 21 hours.
                 To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Since she has already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

To find the total cost of buying each cup, we first need to determine the total cost of half a dozen plates. Since each plate costs $6000, the total cost of half a dozen plates is $6000 * 0.5 = $3000.
Next, we know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates, which is $3000. Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $3000 - $1200 = $1800.
Now, we need to find the cost of one cup. Since twenty dozen cups cost $1800, we can divide $1800 by 20 to get the cost of one dozen cups, which is $1800 / 20 = $90. Then, we can divide $90 by 12 to get the cost of one cup, which is $90 / 12 = $7.50.

To find the speed at which Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance, we first need to calculate the total time she has available to complete the hike. Since she wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour and the total distance is 12 miles, the total time she has available is 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours. She has already used 2 hours (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles), so she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left. The remaining distance is 12 miles - 4 miles - 2 miles = 6 miles. To find the required speed, we divide the remaining distance by the remaining time: 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour. Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile hike.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many people Billy can help in a day, we need to multiply the number of people he can help per hour (2) by the number of hours he works per day (3). This gives us 2 * 3 = 6 people per day.
                 Next, we need to find out how many days Billy is available to work. Since he takes 20% of the days between March 1st and April 19th off, we need to calculate 20% of 19 days. 20% of 19 is 0.20 * 19 = 3.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we'll round down to 3 days off.
                 So, Billy is available to work 31 - 3 = 28 days.

He started with 24 lollipops.  He gave 14 to his friends.  He ate 2 on the way to school, 3 that night, and 2 in the morning, for a total of 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 lollipops eaten.  Subtracting the number of lollipops he gave to his friends and the number of lollipops he ate from the total number of lollipops he started with, we get 24 - 14 - 7 = 3.  Oscar now has 3 lollipops.  He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.  He gave 14 lollipops to his friends, so he buys 2 x 14 = 28 lollipops.  He now has 3 + 28 = 31 lollipops.  Oscar now has 31 lollipops.

Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes.  Since he won by 10 minutes, James' total time must be 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.  Since James is 10% faster on the swim, his swim time must be 0.9 * 40 = 36 minutes.  Since James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, his bike time must be 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.  Since James' total time is 180 minutes, his run time must be 180 - 36 - 85 = 59 minutes.  Therefore, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of hours the 20 playlists will last, we need to multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist, and then multiply the result by the length of each song.
                 First, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist: 20 playlists * 300 songs/playlist = 6000 songs.
                 Then, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song: 6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours.

To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of the hat, jacket, and pants. The hat costs $25. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, which is 3 x $25 = $75. The pants cost the average of the hat and jacket, which is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50. The total cost of each uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants, which is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150. Therefore, each uniform costs $150 total.<|eot_id|>

To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total sales from each item and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the total sales from the milkshakes. Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so the total sales from milkshakes is 6 x $5.50 = $33.
Next, let's calculate the total sales from the burger platters. Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so the total sales from burger platters is 9 x $11 = $99.
Finally, let's calculate the total sales from the sodas. Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so the total sales from sodas is 20 x $1.50 = $30.
Now, let's add the total sales from each item together to find the total amount of money Terry makes. $33 + $99 + $30 = $162.
Therefore, Terry makes a total of $162.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many rats are in each cage, we first need to find out how many pieces of straw were given to the hamsters and the rabbits. Since there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 x 5 = 50. Since there are 20 pieces of straw given to the rabbits, the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters and the rabbits is 50 + 20 = 70. Since 160 pieces of straw were distributed among the small rodents, the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 160 - 70 = 90. Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 / 6 = 15. Since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 15 / 3 = 5. Therefore, there are 5 rats in each cage.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window, we need to find the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to be at least 20 feet tall. Since the beanstalk doubles its height every day and starts out 4 feet tall, we can calculate the height of the beanstalk on each day as follows:
                 Day 1: 4 feet
                 Day 2: 4 x 2 = 8 feet
                 Day 3: 8 x 2 = 16 feet
                 Day 4: 16 x 2 = 32 feet
                 On Day 4, the beanstalk is 32 feet tall, which is greater than Mark's window height of 20 feet. Therefore, it will take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.<|eot_id|>

To determine the cost per serving, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and divide it by the number of servings.
First, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. Antoine wants to double the amount of onions, so he needs 2 x 2 pounds = 4 pounds of onions. Since the onions are on sale for $2.00 a pound, the total cost of the onions is 4 pounds x $2.00/pound = $8.00.
Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the beef stock. Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box is on sale for $2.00. The total cost of the beef stock is 2 boxes x $2.00/box = $4.00.
Now, we can calculate the total cost of the ingredients by adding the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock. The total cost is $8.00 + $4.00 = $12.00.
Since Antoine's soup serves 6 people, we can calculate the cost per serving by dividing the total cost by the number of servings. The cost per serving is $12.00 ÷ 6 = $2.00.
Therefore, the cost

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first find out how many points the other three students scored. We know that Naomi scored 68 points. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Yuri scored 10 more than that, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points. Now that we know how many points the other three students scored, we can find out how many points Jojo scored by subtracting the total points scored by the other three students from the total points scored by all four students. The total points scored by the other three students is 68 + 44 + 85 = 197. The total points scored by all four students is 251. Therefore, Jojo scored 251 - 197 = 54 points.

To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts with a buy one get one 50% off deal. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. So, the first T-shirt costs $8. The second T-shirt is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. The total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The original price of the shoes is $40, and they are 40% off. So, the discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. The price of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.
Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes together to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 + $24 = $36.

To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for each job.
                 First, let's calculate the net pay for Job A. Job A pays $15 an hour for 2000 hours a year, so the total pay is $15 * 2000 = $30,000. Since the state charges a 20% total tax rate, the tax amount is $30,000 * 0.20 = $6,000. Therefore, the net pay for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.
                 Next, let's calculate the net pay for Job B. Job B pays $42,000 a year, and the state charges $6,000 in property tax. So, the net income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000. Since the state charges a 10% tax rate on net income after property tax, the tax amount is $36,000 * 0.10 = $3,600. Therefore, the net pay for Job B is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

To determine how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, we need to divide the total number of pages in the book by the number of pages he plans to read each day. The total number of pages in the book is 200, and Mike plans to read 10 pages a day.
                 200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days
                 Therefore, it will take Mike 20 days to finish the book. Since the assignment is to be completed within 30 days, Mike will finish his reading 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline.
                 Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream she will need to buy.  Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night, after 60 days, she will have eaten 60 servings of ice cream.  Since each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream, she will need to buy 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.  Since each carton costs $4.00, she will spend 4 x $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.  Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream after 60 days.<|eot_id|>

To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we need to multiply the probability of the first ticket winning by the probability of the second ticket winning. The probability of the first ticket winning is 20%, or 0.20. The probability of the second ticket winning is three times the probability of the first ticket winning, which is 3 x 0.20 = 0.60. Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 0.20 x 0.60 = 0.12. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.12 x 100 = 12%. Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we first need to determine the total number of vehicles that were already present at the port on the first day. Since there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each, the total number of vehicles on the first day is 2 * 5 = 10.
                 Next, we subtract the number of vehicles on the first day from the total number of vehicles on the second day to find the number of vehicles that were imported on the second day: 30 - 10 = 20.
                 Since each container contains 5 vehicles, we divide the number of vehicles imported on the second day by 5 to find the number of containers: 20 / 5 = 4.
                 Therefore, the number of containers that were imported on the second day is 4.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Joe will have left after the purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the outfit before tax and then add the sales tax.
                 First, we need to calculate the discount on the outfit. The discount is 30% of the total price of the outfit. The total price of the outfit is $25 + $35 = $60. The discount is 30% of $60, which is 0.3 x $60 = $18.
                 The price of the outfit after the discount is $60 - $18 = $42.
                 Next, we need to calculate the sales tax. The sales tax is 8% of the price of the outfit after the discount. The sales tax is 0.08 x $42 = $3.36.
                 The total cost of the outfit is the price of the outfit after the discount plus the sales tax, which is $42 + $3.36 = $45.36.
                 Finally, we need to subtract the total cost of the outfit from the amount of money Joe has to buy the outfit. Joe has $50, so he will have $50 - $45.36 = $4.64 left after the purchase.

To find out how many roses they can plant, we first need to find out how much soil they have left after planting the 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.

                 10 carnations need 10 x 1.5 = 15 pounds of soil.
                 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations need 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil.
                 Since they started with 30 pounds of soil, they have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.
                 Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, they can plant 3 / 1 = 3 roses.

To find out how many slices are left, we first need to determine how many slices Jenny gave away. She gave 1/3 of the pizza to Bill and 1/4 of the pizza to Mark. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. So, we convert both fractions to have a denominator of 12. 1/3 is equal to 4/12, and 1/4 is equal to 3/12. Now we can add the fractions: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12. This means that Jenny gave away 7 slices of pizza. She started with 12 slices and gave away 7, so she had 12 - 7 = 5 slices left. However, Jenny also ate 2 slices. Therefore, the number of slices left is 5 - 2 = 3. The answer is 3.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many square feet of fabric Jim needs to buy, we need to calculate the area of the comforter he wants to make. The comforter will be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so its dimensions will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long and 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide. To find the area, we multiply the length by the width: 8 x 10 = 80 square feet. Therefore, Jim needs to buy 80 square feet of fabric.
                 Alternatively, we can calculate the area of the bed and then add the extra 2 feet to both the length and the width. The area of the bed is 6 x 8 = 48 square feet. Adding 2 feet to both the length and the width gives us an area of (6 + 2) x (8 + 2) = 8 x 10 = 80 square feet. Therefore, Jim needs to buy 80 square feet of fabric.
                 In either case, Jim needs to buy 80 square feet of fabric to make the comforter.<|eot_id|>

To find the length of the red rope, we first need to determine the length of the yellow rope. Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, we can represent the length of the yellow rope as Y and the length of the blue rope as Y - 7. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can represent the length of the red rope as 4 * (Y - 7). We know that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation: Y + (Y - 7) + 4 * (Y - 7) = 37. Solving for Y, we get: Y + Y - 7 + 4Y - 28 = 37. Combining like terms, we get: 6Y - 35 = 37. Adding 35 to both sides, we get: 6Y = 72. Dividing both sides by 6, we get: Y = 12. Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4 * (12 - 7) = 4 * 5 = 20 centimeters

To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week, we need to calculate the total number of crates he sold. Since he was closed on Monday and Friday, he only sold on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and the weekend. The total number of crates he sold is 20 (weekend) + 15 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 18 (Thursday) = 65. To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we need to subtract the total number of crates he sold from his target. 120 (target) - 65 (total sold) = 55. Therefore, Sam was 55 crates off from his target for the week.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days, we need to find the number of trees planted on each day and add them together.
On the first day, Mr. Julius planted 20 trees of White Oak. Since he planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 trees of Lodgepole Pine. Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the first day is 20 + 40 = 60 trees.
On the second day, Mr. Julius planted 10 more White Oak trees than on the first day, so he planted 20 + 10 = 30 trees of White Oak. Since he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day, he planted 40 + (1/4 * 40) = 40 + 10 = 50 trees of Lodgepole Pine. Therefore, the total number of trees planted on the second day is 30 + 50 = 80 trees.
The total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 60 + 80 = 140 trees.
Therefore, the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days is 140.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of sticks, we need to add the number of red sticks, blue sticks, and yellow sticks. We know there are 9 red sticks. The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the number of red sticks, so there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks. To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34. Therefore, there are 34 sticks in total.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing, we need to calculate the difference in temperature between the day and the night, and then divide that difference by the amount of heat each log provides.
                 The temperature difference between the day and the night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.
                 Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, we can divide the temperature difference by the amount of heat each log provides to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn:
                 12 degrees / 5 degrees per log = 2.4 logs
                 Since Carson can't burn a fraction of a log, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure the pipes don't freeze. Therefore, Carson needs to burn 3 logs of wood to prevent the pipes from freezing.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total cost of replacing the carpet in Michael's bedroom, we need to calculate the total square footage of the room, the cost of the new carpet, the cost of the padding, the cost of removing the old carpet, and the cost of installing the new carpet.

To determine how many times Sara must mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes, we need to calculate the total amount of money she needs to earn. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost is $30 + $20 + $20 = $70. Since Sara already had $10 saved, she needs to earn $70 - $10 = $60 more. She earns $5 each time she babysits and $4 each time she mows the lawn. To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide the amount she needs to earn ($60) by the amount she earns from mowing the lawn ($4). $60 ÷ $4 = 15.

To find out how many oranges Mrs. Harrington sold, we first need to calculate the total number of oranges she bought. Since each box contains 20 oranges and she bought 12 boxes, the total number of oranges is 12 * 20 = 240 oranges.
Next, we need to find out how many oranges she gave away. She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 boxes. Since each box contains 20 oranges, the total number of oranges she gave away is 4 * 20 = 80 oranges.
After giving away 80 oranges, Mrs. Harrington was left with 240 - 80 = 160 oranges. Since she kept 1/4 of the oranges, the number of oranges she kept is 1/4 * 160 = 40 oranges.
To find out how many oranges she sold, we subtract the number of oranges she kept from the total number of oranges. So, the number of oranges she sold is 240 - 40 = 200 oranges.

                 Next, we need to calculate how much money Janet makes per week.  She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips.  Since she works 40 hours a week, we can calculate her weekly earnings as follows:
                 Weekly earnings from wages = $10/hour x 40 hours/week = $400/week
                 Weekly earnings from tips = $15/hour x 40 hours/week = $600/week
                 Total weekly earnings = $400/week + $600/week = $1,000/week
                 Finally, we can divide the total amount of money Janet needs to save ($2,000) by her total weekly earnings ($1,000) to determine how many weeks she will need to work to save the down payment.

To find John's average score across the 4 tests, we need to add up the scores of all 4 tests and then divide by the total number of tests.
                 First, we add up the scores of the first 3 tests: 100 + 100 + 100 = 300.
                 Then, we add the score of the 4th test: 300 + 80 = 380.
                 Finally, we divide the total score by the total number of tests: 380 ÷ 4 = 95.
                 Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many deviled egg halves Lori will need, multiply the number of guests by the number of deviled egg halves each guest will eat. 16 guests x 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves.  Since Lori needs 2 deviled egg halves per egg, divide 48 by 2. 48 ÷ 2 = 24 eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, divide 24 by 12. 24 ÷ 12 = 2.

To find out how much John paid for the phones, we need to calculate the cost of each phone and add them up.
                 The first two phones cost $600 each, so that's 2 x $600 = $1200.
                 The next two phones cost half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.
                 The last two phones also cost half price, which is $600 / 2 = $300.
                 So the total cost of all the phones is $1200 + $300 + $300 = $1800.

To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars sold (64) by the total number of boxes sold by both Lisa and Peter (3.5 + 4.5 = 8).
                 64 ÷ 8 = 8
                 Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.
                 Alternatively, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of chocolate bars in a box. Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box.
                 3.5x + 4.5x = 64
                 8x = 64
                 x = 64 ÷ 8
                 x = 8
                 Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

To determine how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we need to calculate the amount of gas his car uses per week and then multiply it by the price of gas.
                 First, we need to calculate the amount of gas his car uses per day. Since his car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles, his car uses 5/10 = 0.5 gallons of gas per day.
                 Since Andy only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he uses his car 5 days a week. Therefore, his car uses 0.5 * 5 = 2.5 gallons of gas per week.
                 Now, we need to multiply the amount of gas his car uses per week by the price of gas. The current price for regular gas is $3/gallon. Therefore, the amount of money Andy's car is consuming per week is 2.5 * $3 = $7.50.
                 So, Andy's car is consuming $7.50 per week if he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday and the one-way distance between his home and office is 5 miles.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week, we first need to calculate how much he spent on wooden action figures and how much he spent on plastic action figures. Since he spent an equal amount each day for one week, he spent $70 / 7 days = $10 per day. From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent $10 * 3 days = $30 on wooden action figures. Since each wooden action figure costs $5, he bought $30 / $5 = 6 wooden action figures. For the rest of the week, he spent $10 * 4 days = $40 on plastic action figures. Since each plastic action figure costs $2, he bought $40 / $2 = 20 plastic action figures. Therefore, by the end of the week, Peter will have 6 wooden action figures and 20 plastic action figures, for a total of 6 + 20 = 26 action figures. The answer is 26.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob. Since Kris kept 9 stickers, Kris must have had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. We know that Kris got 7 stickers from Luis, so Luis must have had 16 + 7 = 23 stickers. We know that Luis used half of his stickers, so Luis must have had 2 * 23 = 46 stickers. We know that Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Seth must have had 2 * 46 = 92 stickers.

## Step 1: Calculate the number of birds scared away
To find out how many birds were scared away, we need to calculate 1/3 of the total number of birds Jeremy saw initially, which is 12.
## Step 2: Calculate 1/3 of 12
1/3 of 12 can be calculated by dividing 12 by 3, which equals 4. So, 4 birds were scared away.
## Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of birds
After scaring away 4 birds, the remaining number of birds in the backyard is 12 - 4 = 8.
## Step 4: Add the new birds that joined
A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. To find the total number of birds now, we need to add the new birds to the remaining birds.

To determine how many books Bob can buy per school, we need to divide the total amount of money he has ($27000) by the number of schools (3) and then divide the result by the cost of one book ($500).
                 First, we divide the total amount of money by the number of schools: $27000 ÷ 3 = $9000.
                 Then, we divide the result by the cost of one book: $9000 ÷ $500 = 18.
                 Therefore, Bob can buy 18 books per school.<|eot_id|>

To determine the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to calculate the weekly earnings and then multiply it by the number of weeks in a month.
                 First, we need to calculate the weekly earnings. The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session. Since the studio is rented 3 days a week, the weekly rental cost is $25 * 3 = $75.
                 Next, we need to calculate the weekly earnings from the students. The dance studio has 10 students, and each student pays $1.50 per session. So, the weekly earnings from the students is $1.50 * 10 * 3 = $45.
                 Now, we can calculate the total weekly earnings by adding the weekly rental cost and the weekly earnings from the students. The total weekly earnings is $75 + $45 = $120.
                 Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month by multiplying the total weekly earnings by 4. The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $120 * 4 = $480.
                 Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $480.<|eot_id|>

At 8:00, 5000 people lined up at a polling station to cast their vote on election day. By midday, 2/5 of 5000 people had voted, which is (2/5) * 5000 = 2000 people. This means that 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people had not voted by midday. By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining 3000 people had voted, which is (2/3) * 3000 = 2000 people. This means that 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00. The answer is 1000.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes
To find the number of fish with red stripes, we need to calculate one-third of the total number of fish. total_fish = 66, fish_with_red_stripes = total_fish * (1/3) = 66 * (1/3) = 22.
## Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining fish
To find the number of remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish. remaining_fish = total_fish - fish_with_red_stripes = 66 - 22 = 44.
## Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes
To find the number of fish with blue stripes, we need to calculate 5/11 of the remaining fish. fish_with_blue_stripes = remaining_fish * (5/11) = 44 * (5/11) = 20.
## Step 4: Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes
To find the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes. total_fish_with_stripes = fish_with_red

To find out how much each of the friends paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the tickets, food, and rides, and then divide it by 3.
First, let's calculate the cost of the tickets: $20.25.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the food. Since they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets, we subtract $4.50 from the cost of the tickets: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
Now, let's calculate the cost of the rides. They went on 2 different rides, and each ride costs $33. So, the total cost of the rides is 2 x $33 = $66.
Now, let's add up the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.
Finally, let's divide the total cost by 3 to find out how much each of the friends paid: $102 ÷ 3 = $34.

In this case, the length is 6 feet, the width is 4 feet, and the height is 3 feet. So, the volume of the hole is 6 x 4 x 3 = 72 cubic feet. Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, the total time it will take him to dig the hole is 72 x 3 = 216 seconds.

To find the total weight of the redwood tree, we need to calculate the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites and subtract it from the total weight of the tree.
                 First, we need to find the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites. Since termites ate 30% of the wood, we need to calculate 30% of the total weight of the tree.
                 30% of 400 pounds is 0.3 x 400 = 120 pounds. This is the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites.
                 Next, we need to find the weight of the wood that was not eaten by termites. Since 30% of the wood was eaten, 70% of the wood was not eaten.
                 70% of 400 pounds is 0.7 x 400 = 280 pounds. This is the weight of the wood that was not eaten by termites.
                 Now, we can find the total weight of the tree by adding the weight of the wood that was eaten by termites and the weight of the wood that was not eaten by termites.
                 The total weight of the tree is 120 pounds + 280 pounds = 400 pounds.

To calculate the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day, we first need to determine the number of math teachers on the court. Since 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, we can find the number of math teachers by subtracting the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers.
                 60% of 150 = 0.6 x 150 = 90 history teachers
                 150 total teachers - 90 history teachers = 60 math teachers
                 Now that we know there are 60 math teachers, we can calculate the total time they collectively spend sleeping in one day. Since each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each teacher sleeps.
                 60 math teachers x 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours
                 Therefore, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of cake slices that remained on the plate, we need to follow the sequence of events described in the instruction.
First, Mara added 3 slices of cake to a plate that already had 2 slices on it. So, the total number of slices on the plate is 2 + 3 = 5.
Next, Mara tripled the number of slices she currently has. Since she had 5 slices, she now has 5 * 3 = 15 slices.
Then, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.
Finally, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, leaving her with 13 - 5 = 8 slices.
Therefore, the number of cake slices that remained on the plate is 8.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many hours Tyler has to work to afford his books, we need to first calculate the total cost of the books. The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8, so the total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39. Tyler has saved $14, so he still needs $39 - $14 = $25 to afford the books. Since Tyler earns $5 per hour, we can divide the amount he needs ($25) by his hourly wage ($5) to find out how many hours he needs to work: $25 ÷ $5 = 5 hours. Therefore, Tyler needs to work 5 hours to afford his books.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Tasha made from lemonade sales, we need to first calculate how much she made from mowing lawns. We know that she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's, and she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. Let's represent the number of times she mowed Joe's lawn as "x". Then, the number of times she mowed Kamala's lawn is 3x, and the number of times she mowed Alba's lawn is 5x. We know that Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, so we can set up the equation 6x = 6. Solving for x, we get x = 1. This means that Tasha mowed Joe's lawn once, Kamala's lawn three times, and Alba's lawn five times. The total number of times she mowed lawns is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Since she mowed lawns 9 times, she made 9 * $6 = $54 from mowing lawns. To find out how much she made from lemonade sales, we subtract the amount she made from mowing

To find the number of players on the defense, we need to divide the total number of team members (105) by the sum of the ratios of offense, defense, and special teams players. Since there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense, the ratio of offense to defense is 2:1. Since there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense, the ratio of special teams to defense is 1:2. The sum of these ratios is 2:1 + 1:2 = 3:1. To find the number of players on the defense, we divide the total number of team members (105) by the sum of the ratios (3). 105 ÷ 3 = 35. Therefore, there are 35 players on the defense.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many rows of flowers Jackson will plant, we need to divide the total number of red tulips by the number of red tulips that can fit in a row, and the total number of blue tulips by the number of blue tulips that can fit in a row. Then, we add the number of rows of red tulips to the number of rows of blue tulips.
                 Number of rows of red tulips = Total number of red tulips / Number of red tulips that can fit in a row
                 Number of rows of red tulips = 36 / 6
                 Number of rows of red tulips = 6
                 Number of rows of blue tulips = Total number of blue tulips / Number of blue tulips that can fit in a row
                 Number of rows of blue tulips = 24 / 8
                 Number of rows of blue tulips = 3
                 Total number of rows of flowers = Number of rows of red tulips + Number of rows of blue tulips
                 Total number of rows of flowers = 6 + 3
                 Total number of rows of flowers = 9
                 Therefore, Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought.  She bought 2 pounds of taffy at $3 per pound, so the cost of the taffy is 2 x $3 = $6.  She also bought a bag of seashells for $1.50 and 4 magnets for $0.25 each, so the cost of the seashells and magnets is $1.50 + (4 x $0.25) = $1.50 + $1.00 = $2.50.  The total cost of the items she bought is $6 + $2.50 = $8.50.  Sally started with $10, so she has $10 - $8.50 = $1.50 left.  The answer is $1.50.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many tablespoons of dry ingredients Svetlana would need to make 16 muffins, we need to calculate the total amount of flour, sugar, and salt required for 16 muffins.
                 First, we calculate the amount of flour needed for 16 muffins: 5 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 80 tablespoons.
                 Next, we calculate the amount of sugar needed for 16 muffins: 3 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 48 tablespoons.
                 Finally, we calculate the amount of salt needed for 16 muffins: 0.25 tablespoons/muffin * 16 muffins = 4 tablespoons.
                 To find the total amount of dry ingredients needed, we add the amounts of flour, sugar, and salt together: 80 tablespoons + 48 tablespoons + 4 tablespoons = 132 tablespoons.
                 Therefore, Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many ml of water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total calories she burns. She spends 2 hours doing aerobics, which burns 500 calories/hour, so she burns 2 x 500 = 1000 calories. She also spends 1 hour running, which burns 600 calories/hour, so she burns 1 x 600 = 600 calories. The total calories she burns is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. Since she needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, she needs to drink 1600 / 200 = 8 ml of water. Therefore, Hannah needs to drink 8 ml of water.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Determine the number of books Ahmed read
Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, we can divide the number of books Ezra read by 2 to find the number of books Ahmed read. Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.
## Step 2: Calculate the total number of books Ezra read
Ezra read 300 books initially and decided to read 150 more. So, the total number of books Ezra read is 300 + 150 = 450 books.
## Step 3: Calculate the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read
To find the total number of books both Ezra and Ahmed read, we need to add the number of books each of them read. The total number of books is 150 (Ahmed) + 450 (Ezra) = 600 books.
The final answer is: $\boxed{600}$<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, we need to calculate the number of people who entered the bus at the first and second stations, and then determine the number of passengers on the bus after the third station.
                 Initially, the bus had 20 people. At the first station, 40 people entered the bus. So, the total number of people on the bus became 20 + 40 = 60.
                 At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 * 40 = 30 people entered at the second station. So, the total number of people on the bus became 60 + 30 = 90.
                 At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. So, the total number of people on the bus became 90 * 2 = 180.
                 Since the bus has a capacity of 200 people, the remaining spaces on the bus are 200 - 180 = 20.
                 Therefore, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 20.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of children following the truck, we need to calculate the number of children on each street and add them together.
                 On the first street, there are 5 children.

To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we need to calculate the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours, and then add them together.
                 Distance = Speed x Time
                 In the first 4 hours, Mason traveled at a speed of 8 miles per hour. So, the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours is:
                 Distance = 8 miles/hour x 4 hours
                 Distance = 32 miles
                 In the next 6 hours, Mason traveled at the same speed of 8 miles per hour. So, the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours is:
                 Distance = 8 miles/hour x 6 hours
                 Distance = 48 miles
                 To find the total distance traveled by Mason, we add the distance he traveled in the first 4 hours and the distance he traveled in the next 6 hours:
                 Total Distance = 32 miles + 48 miles

To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to calculate how many yogurts he eats in 30 days.  Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, he eats 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts in 30 days.  Since the yogurts are on sale for 4 yogurts for $5.00, we need to divide 60 yogurts by 4 yogurts to find out how many sets of yogurts he buys.  60 yogurts / 4 yogurts = 15 sets.  Since each set costs $5.00, we need to multiply 15 sets by $5.00 to find out how much he spends.  15 sets x $5.00 = $75.00.  Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef he will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide 80 by 16 to find out how many pounds of meat he will need.

To find out how much Ellen pays for one carrot every day, we first need to determine the cost of the yogurt. Since the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt costs $6 / 2 = $3. The total cost of Ellen's daily goods is $6 (salad) + $3 (yogurt) + $2 (two carrots) = $11. Since the total cost is $11 and the cost of the salad and yogurt is $6 + $3 = $9, the cost of the two carrots must be $11 - $9 = $2. Therefore, Ellen pays $2 for two carrots every day. To find the cost of one carrot, we divide the cost of two carrots by 2, which is $2 / 2 = $1. So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.<|eot_id|>

John's initial funding was $100,000 for the first 5 months of research.  After the first 5 months, his research took 10 times as long, which is 50 months.  Each month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding than the previous month.  To calculate the total cost of his research, we need to calculate the cost of the first 5 months and the cost of the remaining 50 months.
                 The cost of the first 5 months is $100,000.  To calculate the cost of the remaining 50 months, we need to calculate the funding per month for each of those months.  Since each month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding than the previous month, we can calculate the funding per month as follows:
                 Month 1: $100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000
                 Month 2: $150,000 x 1.5 = $225,000
                 Month 3: $225,000 x 1.5 = $337,500
                 Month 4: $337,500 x 1.5 = $506,250

To find out how much money Cameron would save, we need to calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay and the cost of the additional hours. First, let's calculate the cost of the 12-hour stay. The cost of the 12-hour stay is 1000 pesos. Next, let's calculate the cost of the additional hours. Since Cameron wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, he will be staying for 5 hours after the 12-hour mark. The cost of the additional hours is 5 x 70 = 350 pesos. Therefore, the total cost of the stay is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos. To find out how much money Cameron would save, we need to subtract the cost of the 12-hour stay from the cost of the 24-hour stay. The cost of the 24-hour stay is 1600 pesos. Therefore, the amount of money Cameron would save is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos. Cameron would save 250 pesos by choosing the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days in minutes, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the number of hours Sandy walked on the first day.
Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.
Step 2: Calculate the number of hours Sandy walked on the second day.
Since Sandy walked half as many hours on the second day as she walked on the first day, she walked for 8/2 = 4 hours on the second day.
Step 3: Calculate the total number of hours Sandy walked in the two days.
Total hours = hours walked on the first day + hours walked on the second day
Total hours = 8 + 4
Total hours = 12 hours
Step 4: Convert the total number of hours to minutes.
1 hour = 60 minutes
Total minutes = total hours * 60
Total minutes = 12 * 60
Total minutes = 720 minutes
Therefore, Sandy took a total of 720 minutes to walk in the two days.<|eot_id|>

To find the length of Movie A, we first need to determine the length of Movie C in minutes. Since Movie C was 1.25 hours, we can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).
                 1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes
                 Now that we know Movie C is 75 minutes long, we can find the length of Movie B. Since Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, we can add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C.
                 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes
                 Finally, we can find the length of Movie A. Since Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, we can divide the length of Movie B by 4.

To find out how many kilowatts of electric energy Mel will save by reducing the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we first need to find out how many kilowatt-hours (kWh) of energy the air conditioner uses each day. Since the AC uses 900 watts of energy each hour, and there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, the AC uses 0.9 kilowatts of energy each hour. Since Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, the AC uses 0.9 x 8 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours of energy each day. If Mel reduces the time he uses the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, the AC will use 7.2 - 5 = 2.2 kilowatt-hours of energy each day. In 30 days, the AC will use 2.2 x 30 = 66 kilowatt-hours of energy.

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it takes for Grandma to walk 1 mile on the beach.  Since 40 minutes of her walk is spent on the beach, and the beach is 2 miles long, we can divide 40 minutes by 2 miles to get the time it takes for her to walk 1 mile on the beach. 40 minutes / 2 miles = 20 minutes per mile.  Since the sidewalk is 1 mile long, and Grandma walks on the sidewalk at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach, it will take her half the time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk. 20 minutes per mile / 2 = 10 minutes per mile.  Since the sidewalk is 1 mile long, it will take her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.  To find out how long it takes for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, we need to add the time it takes for her to walk 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk. 20 minutes per mile * 2 miles = 40 minutes. 10 minutes per mile * 1 mile = 10 minutes. 40 minutes + 10 minutes

To find the number of yellow balloons, we first need to determine how many pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons.  We know that Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon and 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.  We also know that he threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna.  Since there are 20 red balloons, we can find the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons by multiplying the number of red balloons by the number of pieces of bologna thrown at each red balloon.  20 x 2 = 40.  This means that 40 pieces of bologna were thrown at the red balloons.  To find the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons, we subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces of bologna.  58 - 40 = 18.  Since 3 pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces of bologna thrown at each yellow balloon.  18 / 3 = 6.  Therefore

To find out how much money Adam loses, we first need to calculate how much money he has invested in the rock stand. Since he invests all his money in the rock stand, he invests $100.
Next, we need to calculate how many rocks he can buy with his money. Since each rock costs $5, he can buy $100/$5 = 20 rocks.
Now, we need to calculate how many rocks he sells. Since he sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 60% of 20 rocks, which is 0.6 x 20 = 12 rocks.
Now, we need to calculate how much money he makes from selling the rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, he makes $7 x 12 = $84.
Finally, we need to calculate how much money he loses. Since he invested $100 and made $84, he loses $100 - $84 = $16.
Therefore, Adam loses $16.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the value of the two houses combined, we first need to find the value of Juan's house. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we need to find 30% of the value of Herb's house and subtract it from the value of Herb's house.
                 30% of $76,000 is 0.3 x $76,000 = $22,800.
                 The value of Juan's house is $76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200.
                 To find the value of the two houses combined, we need to add the value of Juan's house and the value of Herb's house.
                 The value of the two houses combined is $53,200 + $76,000 = $129,200.

To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to calculate the amount of dog food she will use in the first 180 days and the amount of dog food she will use in the remaining 365 - 180 = 185 days. In the first 180 days, Cecilia will use 180 cups of dog food. In the remaining 185 days, she will use 2 * 185 = 370 cups of dog food. The total amount of dog food she will use in the first year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, Cecilia will use 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

To find the combined capacity of both schools, we need to calculate the capacity of John's school first. Since each of John's classes has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, and Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can calculate the capacity of one of John's classes as follows:
                 Capacity of one of John's classes = 1/8 * Capacity of Ali's class
                 Capacity of one of John's classes = 1/8 * 120
                 Capacity of one of John's classes = 15 students
                 Since John has two classes, the total capacity of his school is:
                 Total capacity of John's school = 2 * Capacity of one of John's classes
                 Total capacity of John's school = 2 * 15
                 Total capacity of John's school = 30 students
                 To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school:
                 Combined capacity of both schools = Capacity of Ali's school + Total capacity of John's school
                 Combined capacity of both schools = 120 + 30

To find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we need to subtract the number of goats sold from the total number of goats in each farm.
                 First, let's calculate the number of goats sold from each farm. Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, he sold 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.
                 Now, let's subtract the number of goats sold from the total number of goats in each farm. The number of goats left in Farm X is 55 - 10 = 45. The number of goats left in Farm Y is 45 - 20 = 25.
                 To find the total number of goats left in the two farms, we need to add the number of goats left in Farm X and Farm Y. The total number of goats left is 45 + 25 = 70.

To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we first need to calculate the total number of cows in all the stalls after Mr. Sylas buys the new cows. Initially, there were 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so the total number of cows was 10 * 20 = 200. After Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows, the total number of cows becomes 200 + 40 = 240. Since the new cows are divided equally among the 20 stalls, each stall now has 240 / 20 = 12 cows. To find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls, we multiply the number of cows in one stall by 8, which is 12 * 8 = 96. Therefore, there are 96 cows in 8 of the stalls.<|eot_id|>

To find the new balance on Sheila's credit card, we need to calculate the cost of the items she purchased after the discounts and then subtract the cost of the item she returned.
First, let's calculate the cost of the frying pan after the 20% discount:
$20.00 x 0.20 = $4.00
$20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00
Next, let's calculate the cost of the set of towels after the 10% discount:
$30.00 x 0.10 = $3.00
$30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00
Now, let's calculate the total cost of the items she purchased after the discounts:
$16.00 (frying pan) + $27.00 (towels) = $43.00
Since Sheila returned one item that cost $15.00, we need to subtract this amount from the total cost of the items she purchased:
$43.00 - $15.00 = $28.00
Finally, let's calculate the new balance on Sheila's credit card:
$85.00 (initial charge) + $28.00 (new purchases) = $113.00

To determine the number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we first need to find out how many apples she picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. We know that she sold all the apples picked on Monday for $56. Since each apple is sold for $4, we can divide $56 by $4 to find out how many apples she picked on Monday. $56 ÷ $4 = 14 apples. This means that Lucy picked 14 apples on Monday. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday, so she picked 12 x 2 = 24 apples. To find the total number of apples picked over the three days, we need to add the number of apples picked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples. Therefore, Lucy picked 50 apples over the three days.<|eot_id|>

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals while team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals. In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 * 2 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals. Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 4 + 2 + 8 + 2 = 16 goals. The answer is 16.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we first need to find out how many cherries Jerry has. Since Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, we can find out how many cherries Richard has by subtracting 10 from 30. 30 - 10 = 20. So, Richard has 20 cherries. Since there are 60 cherries in total and Robert and Richard have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries. To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we need to subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has. 30 - 10 = 20. So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. The answer is 20.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of people who sang in the performance, we first need to calculate the number of female members in the choir.  Since 50% of the choir members are girls, we can calculate the number of girls by multiplying the total number of choir members by 0.5.  0.5 * 52 = 26.  This means that there are 26 female members in the choir.  Since the choir decided to perform with just its female members, the number of people who sang in the performance is equal to the number of female members, which is 26.  However, on the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it to the show because their bus breaks down.  This means that 26 / 2 = 13 people can't make it to the show.  Therefore, the number of people who sang in the performance is 26 - 13 = 13.  Finally, the choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so the total number of people who sang in the performance is 13 + 3 = 16.  Therefore, 16 people sang in the performance.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of boys in each class, we first need to determine the total number of students in each class. Since there are two classes with a total of 80 students, we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.
                 80 ÷ 2 = 40 students in each class.
                 Since 40% of the students in each class are girls, we can calculate the number of girls in each class by multiplying the total number of students in each class by 0.4.
                 40 students × 0.4 = 16 girls in each class.
                 To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.
                 40 students - 16 girls = 24 boys in each class.

To find out how many coins they are having ten years after they started their savings, we need to calculate the total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in ten years.
                 Since Rong saves 20 coins every month, the total number of coins saved by Rong in one year is 20 * 12 = 240 coins. In ten years, Rong will have saved 240 * 10 = 2400 coins.
                 Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong, so Neil saves 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins every month. The total number of coins saved by Neil in one year is 28 * 12 = 336 coins. In ten years, Neil will have saved 336 * 10 = 3360 coins.
                 The total number of coins saved by both Rong and Neil in ten years is 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins. Therefore, they will have 5760 coins ten years after they started their

Since the total age of the children is 20 and there are four children, the average age can be calculated by dividing the total age by the number of children: 20 ÷ 4 = 5. This means that the average age of the group is 5 years.
Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can calculate her age by multiplying the average age by 2: 5 × 2 = 10. This means that Helene is 10 years old.
We are given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. To find the age of Wilfred, we need to subtract the combined ages of Akbar and Alessandro from the total age: 20 - (3 + 4) = 20 - 7 = 13. This means that the age of Wilfred is 13 years.

Therefore, after fifteen days, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 new limbs (5 extra arms + 3 extra legs).<|eot_id|>

To find the weight of the remaining cake, we need to subtract the weight of the two pieces that Rory and her mom ate from the total weight of the cake. Since each piece weighs 20/8 = 2.5 ounces, the total weight of the two pieces is 2.5 x 2 = 5 ounces. Subtracting this from the total weight of the cake, we get 20 - 5 = 15 ounces. Therefore, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far, we need to calculate the number of pieces he ate on each day and add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the first day. Since he ate 2/5 of the 60 pieces, we can multiply 60 by 2/5 to get the number of pieces he ate on the first day.
                 60 * (2/5) = 24 pieces
                 Next, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the second day. We know that he ate 10 pieces on the second day.
                 Now, let's calculate the number of pieces he ate on the third day. Since he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces, we need to find out how many pieces were remaining after the first two days.
                 After the first day, there were 60 - 24 = 36 pieces remaining.
                 After the second day, there were 36 - 10 = 26 pieces remaining.
                 Now, we can multiply 26 by 7/13 to get the number of pieces he ate on the third day.
                 26 * (7/13) = 14 pieces

To find the number of students who like to play video games, we first need to determine the number of students who like to play music. Since the number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, and there are 5 students who like to play basketball, the number of students who like to play music is 2 * 5 = 10.
                 Now that we know the number of students who like to play music, we can find the number of students who like to play video games by subtracting the number of students who like to play basketball and the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students. The total number of students is 50, so the number of students who like to play video games is 50 - 5 - 10 = 35. Therefore, 35 students like to play video games.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars, we first need to determine the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we can calculate the cost of a half-gallon jar by subtracting $2 from the cost of a gallon jar. Therefore, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3.
Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent on 10-gallon jars. Since a gallon jar costs $5, the total amount of money spent on 10-gallon jars is 10 x $5 = $50.
Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of money spent on 16 half-gallon jars. Since a half-gallon jar costs $3, the total amount of money spent on 16 half-gallon jars is 16 x $3 = $48.
Therefore, the total amount of money Cecelia spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is $50 + $48 = $98.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Melissa makes per hour after expenses, we need to first calculate her total expenses for the 3 days. She spends 6 hours a day for 3 days, so she spends a total of 6 * 3 = 18 hours. She pays $3 for parking each day, so her total parking expenses are 3 * 3 = $9. She is paid $15 per day, so her total pay is 15 * 3 = $45. Her total expenses are 9 + 45 = $54. To find out how much she makes per hour after expenses, we need to divide her total pay by the total number of hours she works, which is 18. So, 45 / 18 = 2.5.

To find Mr. Tan's net proceeds from selling the house, we need to calculate the total amount he paid in fees and subtract it from the selling price, then subtract the remaining loan amount.

                 Next, we calculate the brokerage fee: 5% of $400 000 = 0.05 x $400 000 = $20 000.
                 Then, we add the transfer fees and the brokerage fee: $12 000 + $20 000 = $32 000.
                 Now, we subtract the total fees from the selling price: $400 000 - $32 000 = $368 000.

To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase every two months and add it to the original price. Since the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can calculate the price increase as 20% of $20, which is 0.20 x $20 = $4.
                 After the first two months, the price of the bag of marbles will be $20 + $4 = $24.
                 After the next two months, the price will increase by 20% of $24, which is 0.20 x $24 = $4.80. The new price will be $24 + $4.80 = $28.80.
                 After the next two months, the price will increase by 20% of $28.80, which is 0.20 x $28.80 = $5.76. The new price will be $28.80 + $5.76 = $34.56.
                 After the next two months, the price will increase by 20% of $34.56, which is 0.20 x $34.56 = $6.91. The new

To find out how much William spent, we need to calculate the cost of the notebooks and the cost of the ballpen, and then add them together.
                 The cost of the notebooks is 5 x $1.50 = $7.50.
                 The cost of the ballpen is 1 x $0.5 = $0.50.
                 The total cost is $7.50 + $0.50 = $8.00.

To find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked, we need to calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the calories of the mini cinnamon rolls. A normal cinnamon roll has 600 calories, so a mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of that, which is 600 / 3 = 200 calories. Since Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls, the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls are 200 x 200 = 40,000 calories.
Next, let's calculate the calories of the mini blueberry muffins. A normal blueberry muffin has 450 calories, so a mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of that, which is 450 / 3 = 150 calories. Since Andrew baked 300 mini blueberry muffins, the total calories of the mini blueberry muffins are 300 x 150 = 45,000 calories.
Now, let's add the total calories of the mini cinnamon rolls and the mini blueberry muffins together to find the total calories of the pastries Andrew baked. The total calories are 40,000 + 45,000 = 85,000 calories.

                 Next, let's calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost $80 per dozen, so the total cost of the mini cupcakes is 2 x $80 = $160.

To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we first need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher has. Since the teacher has 9 coupons and each coupon can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher has is 9 * 100 = 900 bottles.
                 Next, we need to calculate the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher gives to the students. Since there are 29 pupils in the class and the teacher gives each student 2 bottles of apple juice, the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher gives to the students is 29 * 2 = 58 bottles.
                 To find out how many bottles of apple juice the teacher has for herself, we need to subtract the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher gives to the students from the total number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher has. Therefore, the number of bottles of apple juice that the teacher has for herself is 900 - 58 = 842 bottles.

To determine what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered after 3 days of traveling at an average speed of 50km/hr, we need to first calculate the total distance he has traveled in 3 days.

                 Since Michael is traveling at an average speed of 50km/hr for 3 days, the total time he has traveled is 3 days * 24 hours/day = 72 hours.
                 Distance = 50 km/hr * 72 hours = 3600 km
                 To find the percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas that Michael has covered, we divide the distance he has traveled (3600 km) by the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) and multiply by 100.
                 Percentage = (3600 km / 6000 km) * 100 = 60%

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of James and Dora.  Since James is twice as old as Dora, and Dora will turn 12 in 3 years, we know that Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.  Since James is twice as old as Dora, James is currently 9 x 2 = 18 years old.  We also know that John had a son James when he was 19, so John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.  John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.  In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

To determine how many packs of gum Parker will need to last him 30 days, we need to multiply the number of pieces of gum he chews per day (4) by the number of days (30).
                 4 pieces of gum per day * 30 days = 120 pieces of gum
                 Since a pack of gum has 15 pieces of gum per pack, we need to divide the total number of pieces of gum Parker will need (120) by the number of pieces of gum per pack (15).
                 120 pieces of gum / 15 pieces of gum per pack = 8 packs of gum
                 Therefore, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars, we first need to determine the number of white shirts with no collars and the number of floral shirts with no buttons.
                 There are 40 white shirts in total, and half of them have collars. So, the number of white shirts with collars is 40 / 2 = 20. Therefore, the number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.
                 There are 50 floral shirts in total, and 20 of them have buttons. So, the number of floral shirts with buttons is 20. To find the number of floral shirts with no buttons, we subtract the number of floral shirts with buttons from the total number of floral shirts: 50 - 20 = 30.
                 Now that we know there are 20 white shirts with no collars and 30 floral shirts with no buttons, we can find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are than white shirts with no collars by subtracting the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.
                 Therefore, there are 10 more

To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we need to determine the price per sandwich for the other two packages and then use that information to calculate the price of the package with 8 sandwiches.
                 First, let's find the price per sandwich for the first package. The price of the first package is $3 for 2 sandwiches, so the price per sandwich is $3 / 2 = $1.50.
                 Next, let's find the price per sandwich for the second package. The price of the second package is $6 for 4 sandwiches, so the price per sandwich is $6 / 4 = $1.50.
                 Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich is the same for all packages. Therefore, the price per sandwich is $1.50.
                 To find the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we multiply the price per sandwich by the number of sandwiches: $1.50 * 8 = $12.
                 Therefore, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of cars the tow truck pulled that week, we need to calculate the number of cars it pulled on the first three days and the number of cars it pulled on the remaining four days.
                 On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars per day. Since there are 3 days, the total number of cars pulled on the first three days is 10 * 3 = 30.
                 On the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars per day, which is 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. Since there are 4 days, the total number of cars pulled on the remaining four days is 6 * 4 = 24.
                 To find the total number of cars pulled that week, we need to add the number of cars pulled on the first three days and the number of cars pulled on the remaining four days. The total number of cars pulled that week is 30 + 24 = 54.

To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay.
                 The first team, being well-rounded, each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Therefore, the total time taken by the first team to complete the relay is 55 x 4 = 220 seconds.
                 The second team, being less well-rounded, their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Therefore, the total time taken by the second team to complete the relay is 60 + (60 - 3) + (60 - 6) + (60 - 9) = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.
                 To determine how many seconds the faster team will win by, we need to subtract the total time taken by the second team from the total time taken by the first team. Therefore, the faster team will win by 220 - 222 = 2 seconds.

To find out how much time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks, we need to calculate the total time she spends each day and then multiply it by the number of days in 4 weeks.
                 Since Charisma meditates for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, she spends a total of 15 + 15 = 30 minutes per day on meditation.
                 She also practices 1 hour (60 minutes) of yoga 5 days a week, so she spends a total of 60 * 5 = 300 minutes per week on yoga.
                 Since there are 7 days in a week, in 4 weeks there are 4 * 7 = 28 days.
                 Therefore, the total time Charisma has spent on meditation/yoga practice in 4 weeks is 30 * 28 + 300 = 840 + 300 = 1140 minutes.
                 To convert this to hours, we can divide by 60: 1140 / 60 = 19 hours.
                 So, in 4 weeks, Charisma has spent a total of 19 hours on meditation/yoga practice.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the tray, we need to divide the total number of eggs he has by the number of eggs each tray can hold. Since Jaime has 64 eggs and each tray can hold 24 eggs, we can divide 64 by 24. 64 ÷ 24 = 2.67. Since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we round down to 2. This means Jaime will be able to place 48 eggs on the 2 trays. To find out how many eggs he won't be able to place, we subtract the number of eggs he can place from the total number of eggs. 64 - 48 = 16.

To determine the total number of letters Elise has written, we need to calculate the number of letters she has written in each step and then add them together.
                 In the first step, Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, she writes 26 x 2 = 52 letters.
                 In the second step, Elise writes half of the alphabet once. Since there are 26 letters in the alphabet, half of it is 26 / 2 = 13 letters.
                 In the third step, Elise re-writes everything she has already written. This means she re-writes the 52 letters she wrote in the first step and the 13 letters she wrote in the second step. So, she re-writes a total of 52 + 13 = 65 letters.
                 To find the total number of letters Elise has written, we add the number of letters she wrote in each step: 52 (first step) + 13 (second step) + 65 (third step) = 130 letters.

To calculate the total cost of renovating the kitchen floor, we need to first determine the total number of tiles required. Since each tile is 1ft in length and the floor area is 200 SqFt, we can calculate the total number of tiles required by dividing the floor area by the area of a single tile. However, since the tiles are square, the area of a single tile is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt. Therefore, the total number of tiles required is 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles.
Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the tiles. Since each tile costs $12, we can multiply the total number of tiles required by the cost of a single tile to get the total cost. Therefore, the total cost of the tiles is 200 tiles * $12/tile = $2400.
Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor with new square floor tiles.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we need to multiply the number of car washes he gets per month by the number of months in a year, and then multiply the result by the cost of each car wash.
                 4 car washes per month * 12 months per year = 48 car washes per year
                 48 car washes per year * $15 per car wash = $720 per year
                 Therefore, Tom pays $720 per year for car washes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Janet paid, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch and then add the insurance cost.  First, we need to calculate the total cost of the brooch.  The cost of the material is $500 and the cost of the construction is $800.  So the total cost of the brooch is $500 + $800 = $1300.  Next, we need to calculate the insurance cost.  The insurance cost is 10% of the total cost of the brooch.  10% of $1300 is 0.1 x $1300 = $130.  So the total cost of the brooch is $1300 + $130 = $1430.  Therefore, Janet paid $1430 for the brooch.<|eot_id|>

To maximize profit, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000. This is because the electronic gadgets market is expected to rise 1.2% within the same month, while the jewelry market is expected to rise only 2.5%. As a result, the value of the electronic gadgets will increase by $96 (1.2% of $8,000), while the value of the jewelry will only increase by $125 (2.5% of $5,000). Therefore, the merchant will make a profit of $96 - $125 = -$29 by choosing the jewelry. In contrast, the merchant will make a profit of $96 by choosing the electronic gadgets. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronic gadgets worth $8,000 to maximize profit at the end of this month.<|eot_id|>

To find the total distance Tyson covered in June, we need to calculate the distance he ran each day and then multiply it by the number of days in June. Since June has 30 days, we will multiply the daily distance by 30.
First, we need to calculate the new daily distance. The coach wants Tyson to run 1/5 times more meters than the original 5000 meters. To find 1/5 of 5000, we multiply 5000 by 1/5, which is the same as dividing 5000 by 5.
5000 ÷ 5 = 1000
So, the coach wants Tyson to run 5000 + 1000 = 6000 meters each day.
Now, we multiply the new daily distance by the number of days in June:
6000 meters/day × 30 days = 180,000 meters
Therefore, if Tyson took the coach's advice and trained for a month, he covered a total distance of 180,000 meters in June.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we first need to find out how many hours of TV he watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, so he watched 2 hours of TV. On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute episode, so he watched 1.5 hours of TV. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so he watched 2 hours of TV. In total, he watched 2 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 7.5 hours of TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Since he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, he must have watched 7.5 - 7 = 0.5 hours of TV on Wednesday. Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours long, Frankie watched 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 episode of a 30-minute show on Wednesday. The answer is 1.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many feet of crepe paper James needs to buy, we need to calculate the perimeter of his backyard fence. The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all four sides. Since the long side is 20 feet and the short side is 15 feet, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:
                 Perimeter = 2 x (long side) + 2 x (short side)
                 Perimeter = 2 x 20 + 2 x 15
                 Perimeter = 40 + 30
                 Perimeter = 70 feet
                 Therefore, James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to hang the streamers from his backyard fence.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Tim spent in total, we first need to calculate the cost of the two packs of fireworks.  The first pack is worth $400.  The second pack is worth twice that much, so it is worth $400 x 2 = $800.  The total cost of the two packs of fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.  Since Tim gets a 20% discount, we need to calculate 20% of $1200.  20% of $1200 is 0.2 x $1200 = $240.  So the discount is $240.  The cost of the two packs of fireworks after the discount is $1200 - $240 = $960.  Finally, we need to add the cost of the finale firework, which is $150.  The total cost is $960 + $150 = $1110.

To find out how much money Judy makes in 1 week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and multiply it by the number of students in each class and the charge per student.
                 First, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week. She teaches 5 classes each weekday, which is 5 classes/day * 5 days = 25 classes. She also teaches 8 classes on Saturday. So, the total number of classes she teaches in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes.
                 Since each class has 15 students, the total number of students she teaches in a week is 33 classes * 15 students/class = 495 students.
                 Judy charges $15.00 per student, so the total amount of money she makes in a week is 495 students * $15.00/student = $7,475.00.

To find the average speed of the car during this trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.
First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 120 miles
Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 1 hour
Distance = 30 miles
Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled:
Total Distance = Distance at 60 mph + Distance at 30 mph
Total Distance = 120 miles + 30 miles
Total Distance = 150 miles
Next, let's calculate the total time taken:
Total Time = Time at 60 mph + Time at 30 mph
Total Time = 2 hours + 1 hour
Total Time = 3 hours
Now, let's calculate the average speed:
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
Average Speed = 150 miles / 3 hours
Average Speed = 50 mph
Therefore, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of trees planted, we need to calculate the number of trees planted by the students and the number of trees planted by the teachers.

                 Next, let's calculate the number of trees planted by the teachers. There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class. So, the total number of teachers is 40 * 3 = 120. Since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240.
                 Therefore, the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign is 1000 (students) + 240 (teachers) = 1240.

To find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we need to calculate the number of cows and chickens separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the number of cows. Melanie's father starts with 50 cows and receives 20 cows per day from Milkie Cows Limited for three weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so three weeks is 3 x 7 = 21 days. Therefore, the total number of cows received is 20 cows/day x 21 days = 420 cows. Adding this to the initial 50 cows, we get 420 + 50 = 470 cows.
Next, let's calculate the number of chickens. Melanie's father starts with 20 chickens and receives 10 chickens per day from Broilers Limited for three weeks. Again, there are 21 days in three weeks. Therefore, the total number of chickens received is 10 chickens/day x 21 days = 210 chickens. Adding this to the initial 20 chickens, we get 210 + 20 = 230 chickens.
Finally, to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, we add the number of cows and chickens together: 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals

To find out how many ounces of water Peter has left, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for each type of cube and then subtract that from the total amount of water he started with (32 ounces).
First, let's calculate the amount of water used for the giant cubes:
3 giant cubes * 4 ounces per cube = 12 ounces
Next, let's calculate the amount of water used for the medium cubes:
7 medium cubes * 2 ounces per cube = 14 ounces
Then, let's calculate the amount of water used for the small cubes:
8 small cubes * 0.5 ounces per cube = 4 ounces
Now, let's add up the total amount of water used:
12 ounces (giant cubes) + 14 ounces (medium cubes) + 4 ounces (small cubes) = 30 ounces
Finally, let's subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water:
32 ounces (initial amount) - 30 ounces (total amount used) = 2 ounces
Therefore, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce 25 liters of milk a day, we first need to calculate the total amount of milk produced by the 3 cows he currently has. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the total amount of milk produced by 3 cows is 3 x 5 = 15 liters a day. To produce 25 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 25 - 15 = 10 more liters of milk. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, the farmer needs 10 / 5 = 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day. Therefore, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.<|eot_id|>

To determine the height of the fourth child, we need to calculate the heights of the first three children first.
                 The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equivalent to 6 x 12 = 72 inches.
                 The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.
                 The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.
                 The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.

To calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks swimming in the sea have, we first need to calculate the number of gallons of blood that one shark has. Since a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the number of gallons of blood that one shark has by multiplying the number of gallons of blood that a whale has by 3.
                 So, the number of gallons of blood that one shark has is 40 * 3 = 120 gallons.
                 Now that we know the number of gallons of blood that one shark has, we can calculate the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have by multiplying the number of gallons of blood that one shark has by 10.
                 So, the number of gallons of blood that ten sharks have is 120 * 10 = 1200 gallons.
                 Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much John pays a year for driving, we need to calculate the total number of miles he drives in a year.  Since he goes to work 5 days a week for 50 weeks a year, he goes to work 5 x 50 = 250 times a year.  Since he has to go to work and back, he drives 30 x 2 = 60 miles each time he goes to work.  Therefore, he drives 60 x 250 = 15,000 miles in a year.  Since he gets charged $2 per mile driven, he pays 15,000 x $2 = $30,000 per year for driving.  Additionally, he gives his driver a $150 bonus per month.  Since there are 12 months in a year, he gives his driver a $150 x 12 = $1,800 bonus per year.  Therefore, he pays a total of $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 per year for driving.  The answer is $31,800.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we first need to find out how many bananas the first two monkeys eat each day. The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas each day. The total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys each day is 10 + 14 = 24 bananas. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of bananas eaten by the first two monkeys in a week is 24 x 7 = 168 bananas. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, the third monkey eats 315 - 168 = 147 bananas in a week. To find out how many bananas the third monkey eats each day, we divide 147 by 7. 147 ÷ 7 = 21 bananas.

To determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we need to break down the task into two parts: peeling and cooking.
First, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. Since she can peel 6 shrimp a minute, we can divide the total number of shrimp (90) by the number of shrimp she can peel per minute (6):
90 shrimp ÷ 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes
Next, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to cook 90 shrimp. Since she can cook 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of shrimp (90) by the number of shrimp she can cook per 10 minutes (30):
90 shrimp ÷ 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes
Since peeling and cooking are two separate tasks, we need to add the time it takes to peel the shrimp to the time it takes to cook the shrimp:
15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 45 minutes
Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends attending classes each week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in the semester.
                 On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has three 1-hour classes each day.  So, he spends 3 x 1 = 3 hours per day on these days.  Since there are 3 of these days in a week, Kimo spends 3 x 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.
                 On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.  So, he spends 2 x 2 = 4 hours per day on these days.  Since there are 2 of these days in a week, Kimo spends 4 x 2 = 8 hours per week on these days.
                 In total, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week attending classes.

To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we need to first calculate the total time he spent on all activities.  He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6/2 = 3 hours swimming.  He watched 3 shows that were 2 hours each, so he spent 3 x 2 = 6 hours watching TV.  The total time spent on these activities is 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 hours.  Since this was 30% of his total time, we can set up the equation 0.3x = 15, where x is the total time spent on vacation.  Solving for x, we get x = 15/0.3 = 50 hours.  Since John spent 40% of his time sightseeing, we can find the amount of time he spent sightseeing by multiplying 0.4 x 50 = 20 hours.  Therefore, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.<|eot_id|>

To find the total cost of Ethan's hand-painted wallpaper, we need to calculate 20% of the original cost and subtract it from the original cost.
                 The original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper is $400.
                 20% of $400 is 0.2 x $400 = $80.
                 Subtracting $80 from the original cost, we get $400 - $80 = $320.
                 Therefore, the total cost of Ethan's hand-painted wallpaper is $320.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many candy bars George bought, we first need to determine how much money he spent on chips. Since each bag of chips costs 40 cents and he bought 3 bags, he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents, or $1.20, on chips. Since he spent $5 in total and had 1% of his money left, he had 0.01 x $5 = $0.05 left. This means he spent $5 - $0.05 = $4.95 on candy bars. Since each candy bar costs 75 cents, or $0.75, we can divide $4.95 by $0.75 to find out how many candy bars he bought. $4.95 / $0.75 = 6.6. Since we can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to 6. Therefore, George bought 6 candy bars.<|eot_id|>

To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, we need to calculate their new heights. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, we can convert 4 feet to inches by multiplying 4 by 12, which equals 48 inches. Adding the 3 inches he grew, Xavier's new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches. To find the difference between their heights, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height: 52 - 51 = 1 inch. Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now is 1 inch.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many days the train goes between services, we first need to calculate the combined distance of the entire trip.  The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, from the second city to the third city is 100 miles, and from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip.  The combined distance of the first two legs of the trip is 75 + 100 = 175 miles.  Therefore, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 - 50 = 125 miles.  The total distance of the entire trip is 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles.  Since the train does this trip 3 times a day, the total distance traveled per day is 300 * 3 = 900 miles.  The train needs service every 18,000 miles.  Therefore, the number of days between services is 18,000 / 900 = 20.  The train goes 20 days between services.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we first need to determine the total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette. The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches used for the body of the sweater, which is 1/10 * 900 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, which is 2 * 90 = 180 stitches. The total number of stitches used for the collar and the rosette is 90 + 180 = 270 stitches. Since the whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, the total number of stitches used for the two sleeves is 1800 - 270 = 1530 stitches. To find out how many stitches each sleeve takes, we divide the total number of stitches used for the two sleeves by 2, which is 1530 / 2 = 765 stitches per sleeve.

To calculate the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we first need to calculate the total amount of time spent cleaning classrooms. Since there are 80 classrooms and it takes 15 minutes per classroom, the total time spent cleaning classrooms is 80 classrooms * 15 minutes/classroom = 1200 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time spent cleaning classrooms is 1200 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 20 hours. Since the custodian works 8 hours per day, the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is 20 hours / 8 hours/day = 2.5 days. To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 2.5 days * 100 = 250%. Therefore, on average, the custodian spends 250% of their day cleaning classrooms.<|eot_id|>

Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3/4 x 120 = 90 units. To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units. Therefore, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid, we need to consider the number of pages printed on each side of the folded paper. Since the paper is folded vertically, the left and right sides will have the same number of pages.
                In this case, page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front. This means that the left side has 2 pages (pages 1 and 2), and the right side has 2 pages (pages 31 and 32).
                Since the left and right sides have the same number of pages, we can multiply the number of pages on one side by 2 to get the total number of pieces of paper used. Therefore, 2 x 2 = 4 pieces of paper would be used in a 32-page tabloid.<|eot_id|>

To find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we first need to determine the age of Alice. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and Beth is 5 years older than Erica, we can calculate Alice's age by adding 7 to Beth's age, and then adding 5 to Erica's age.
                 Erica is 30 years old, so Beth is 30 + 5 = 35 years old. Then, Alice is 35 + 7 = 42 years old.
                 The difference between Alice's age and Erica's age is 42 - 30 = 12 years. Therefore, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we need to calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut all 60 potatoes. Since it takes 1.5 minutes to peel a potato and 5 seconds to cut a potato, we can calculate the time it takes to peel a potato in seconds (1.5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 90 seconds) and the time it takes to cut a potato in seconds (5 seconds). Then, we can multiply the time it takes to peel a potato by the number of potatoes (90 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds) and add the time it takes to cut a potato by the number of potatoes (5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds). The total time is 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the total time to minutes by dividing by 60 (5700 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 95 minutes). Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.<|eot_id|>

To find the percentage of her total work time that Carol spent editing, we need to first find the total amount of time she spent working on the song. We know that she spent 4 hours writing the song and half that much time recording it, which is 4/2 = 2 hours. We also know that she spent 90 minutes editing, which is 90/60 = 1.5 hours. The total amount of time she spent working on the song is 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 hours. To find the percentage of her total work time that she spent editing, we need to divide the amount of time she spent editing (1.5 hours) by the total amount of time she spent working on the song (7.5 hours) and multiply by 100. This gives us (1.5/7.5) x 100 = 20%. Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many seashells each person got, we need to first find out how many seashells each person collected.

We also know that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, so Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. Now that we know how many seashells each person collected, we can divide the total number of seashells by 3 to find out how many each person got. The total number of seashells is 27 + 22 + 11 = 60. Dividing 60 by 3, we get 20. Therefore, each person got 20 seashells. The answer is 20.<|eot_id|>

To find the age of Peter, we can start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than John. Let's represent John's age as "J" and Paul's age as "J + 10". Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, we can represent Peter's age as "J + (J + 10)" which simplifies to "2J + 10".
                 We are also given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We can represent this as an equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100.
                 Simplifying the equation, we get 4J + 20 = 100. Subtracting 20 from both sides, we get 4J = 80. Dividing both sides by 4, we get J = 20.
                 Now that we know John's age is 20, we can find Paul's age by adding 10 to John's age, which gives us 20 + 10 = 30. Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is 30 + 20 = 50.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, they used 18 marshmallows. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, the number of marshmallows left in the bag is 35 - 18 - 3 = 14. Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, the number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows is 14. To find out how many S'mores each kid can have, we need to divide the total number of S'mores they can make with the remaining marshmallows by 2. So, each kid can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores. The answer is 7 S'mores for each kid.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at both $2.50 per package of 3 and $1 per package of 2, and then find the difference.
First, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at $2.50 per package of 3. To do this, we divide 18 by 3 to find out how many packages of 3 Vincent needs to buy: 18 ÷ 3 = 6. Then, we multiply the number of packages by the cost per package: 6 × $2.50 = $15.
Next, let's calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at $1 per package of 2. To do this, we divide 18 by 2 to find out how many packages of 2 Vincent needs to buy: 18 ÷ 2 = 9. Then, we multiply the number of packages by the cost per package: 9 × $1 = $9.
Finally, we subtract the cost of buying 18 flowers at $1 per package of 2 from the cost of buying 18 flowers at $2.50 per package of 3 to find out

To determine how many tickets each graduate would receive, we need to subtract the total number of reserved seats (950 for graduates and 300 for faculty) from the total capacity of the Fine Arts Center (6000).
                 6000 (total capacity) - 950 (reserved seats for graduates) - 300 (reserved seats for faculty) = 3750
                 Since there are 950 graduates, we need to divide 3750 by 950 to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive.
                 3750 ÷ 950 = 3.95
                 Since we can't divide tickets into fractions, we can round down to 3 tickets per graduate. This way, each graduate would receive 3 tickets to give to their friends and family.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we need to first find out how much each roommate will pay per month. We can do this by dividing the total electricity bill ($100) by the number of roommates (4).
                $100 ÷ 4 = $25 per month
                Since there are 12 months in a year, we can multiply the monthly share by 12 to find the yearly share.
                $25 per month × 12 months per year = $300 per year
                Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.<|eot_id|>

To find the school's overall pass rate, we need to calculate the total number of students who passed the test and divide it by the total number of students who took the test. First, we need to find the number of fifth graders who passed the test. Since the pass rate for fifth graders is twice the pass rate for fourth graders, we can multiply the number of fourth graders who passed (40) by 2 to find the number of fifth graders who passed (40 * 2 = 80). Next, we add the number of third graders who passed (340) and the number of fifth graders who passed (80) to find the total number of students who passed the test (340 + 80 = 420). Then, we add the number of third graders (500), fourth graders (100), and fifth graders (400) to find the total number of students who took the test (500 + 100 + 400 = 1000). Finally, we divide the total number of students who passed the test (420) by the total number of students who took the test (1000) to find the school's overall pass rate (420 / 1000 = 0.42 or 42

To find out how many women are left at the party, we first need to determine the total number of people who left. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, and we know that 22 men stayed at the party, we can calculate the total number of people who left. If 22 men stayed, then 25 - 22 = 3 men left. Since 3 men represent 1/4 of the total number of people, we can set up the equation 3 = (1/4)x, where x is the total number of people. Solving for x, we get x = 3 * 4 = 12. This means that a total of 12 people left the party. Since 1/4 of the total number of people left, we can calculate the number of women who left by multiplying 12 by 1/4, which is 3. To find the number of women left, we subtract the number of women who left from the initial number of women: 15 - 3 = 12. Therefore, 12 women are left at the party.<|eot_id|>

Aiden and 12 of his friends are going to see a film at the cinema, and meet up with 7 more friends there. They each save a seat and then buy enough drinks and snacks to fill the seats.

                 The total number of drinks and snacks bought is 40 drinks + 60 snacks = 100 items. Since each item costs $2, the total amount of money spent is 100 items * $2/item = $200.

To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost of the boots on both websites. On Amazon, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4, so the total cost is $16 + $4 = $20. On eBay, the boots cost $13 and shipping costs twice as much, which is $4 x 2 = $8.

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, we subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay: $21 - $20 = $1. Therefore, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of children in the classroom, we need to calculate the number of girls, nongendered children, and add them to the number of boys.
                 Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of girls is 3 * 30 = 90.
                 Since the classroom has 1/10 as many nongendered children as boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of nongendered children is 1/10 * 30 = 3.
                 To find the total number of children, we add the number of boys, girls, and nongendered children: 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.

To determine the cost of each individual razor after the discount, first calculate the total cost of 2 packs of razors without the discount.  Two packs of razors cost 2 x $4.00 = $8.00.  Since the razors are on sale for buy one get one free, Heather will only pay for 1 pack of razors.  The cost of 1 pack of razors is $8.00 - $4.00 = $4.00.  After applying the $2.00 coupon, the total cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.  Since there are 4 razors in a pack, the cost of each individual razor is $2.00 / 4 = $0.50.  Converting this to cents, the cost of each individual razor is $0.50 x 100 = 50 cents.  Therefore, each individual razor will cost 50 cents after the discount if Heather buys 2 packs of razors.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Convert Rob's time from hours to minutes
                 Rob takes 2 hours, which is equivalent to 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.
## Step 2: Calculate double Rob's time
                 Double Rob's time is 2 * 120 = 240 minutes.
## Step 3: Calculate Royce's time
                 Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob, so Royce's time is 240 + 40 = 280 minutes.

To determine how many additional hours it would take for the plane to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate, we first need to find the rate at which the plane is traveling. We can do this by dividing the distance traveled (1200 miles) by the time it took to travel that distance (3 hours). This gives us a rate of 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.
Next, we can use this rate to find the time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles. We can do this by dividing the additional distance (2000 miles) by the rate (400 miles per hour). This gives us 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

                 Next, we calculate the time it takes to dig through the clay: 8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours.
                 Finally, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the time it takes to dig through the clay to get the total time: 6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours.

To find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the weight of the chocolate bars. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g and there are 25 chocolate bars, the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 x 40g = 1000g.
Next, let's calculate the weight of the candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, each candied apple weighs 40g / 2 = 20g. Since there are 80 candied apples, the total weight of the candied apples is 80 x 20g = 1600g.
Now, let's add the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples together to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy. The total weight is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.
Therefore, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600g.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood, we can use the given ratio of electric poles to electric wires, which is 1:3. This means that for every 3 electric wires, 1 electric pole is required. Since the total number of electric wires needed is 45, we can divide 45 by 3 to find the number of electric poles required. 45 ÷ 3 = 15. Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles in the three days, we need to first determine the number of articles she wrote each day.
                 On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
                 On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. 2/5 of 5 is 2, so she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
                 On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Twice 7 is 14, so she wrote 14 articles on Wednesday.
                 The total number of articles she wrote in the three days is 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles.
                 Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to write, the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days is 26 x 4 = 104 hours.

To find the total number of reports that Vince stapled, we need to first find out how many 15-minute intervals are in the time period from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.  Since there are 12 hours in a 12-hour clock, and 60 minutes in an hour, there are 12 x 60 = 720 minutes in a 12-hour clock.  From 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, there are 3 hours, or 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.  Therefore, there are 720 - 180 = 540 minutes in the time period from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.  Since there are 15 minutes in each interval, there are 540 / 15 = 36 intervals.  Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, he can staple 30 x 36 = 1080 reports in 36 intervals.  Therefore, Vince stapled a total of 1080 reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

To find the difference between Ava and Emma's scores, we need to calculate their individual scores and then subtract Emma's score from Ava's score.
First, we know that Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. Let's say Emma jumps on x enemies. Then, Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies. Since they receive 10 points for every enemy they jump on, Ava gets 10(x + 8) points and Emma gets 10x points.
We also know that Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma. Let's say Emma collects y berries. Then, Ava collects y + 3 berries. Since they receive 5 points for each berry they collect, Ava gets 5(y + 3) points and Emma gets 5y points.
Finally, we know that Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma. Since they receive 30 points for every second left on the timer when they finish the level, Ava gets 30(4) points and Emma gets 30(4 - 4) = 30(0) = 0 points.
Now, we can calculate their individual scores:
Ava's score = 10(x + 8) + 5(y + 3) + 30(4)

75% of 24 questions = 0.75 x 24 = 18 questions
Next, let's calculate the number of average and difficult questions she is sure to answer correctly. Since the rest of the questions (60% of the questions) are equally divided as average and difficult questions, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
60% of 60 questions = 0.6 x 60 = 36 questions
Since the average and difficult questions are equally divided, we can calculate the number of average and difficult questions as follows:
36 questions / 2 = 18

To determine the regular price of popcorn, let's break down the information given. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a popcorn and soda for $1 extra. This means that the cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket is $20 - $1 = $19. Since the soda costs $3, the cost of the popcorn can be found by subtracting the cost of the soda from the total cost of the popcorn and soda without the super ticket. Therefore, the cost of the popcorn is $19 - $3 = $16. Since you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, the regular price of the popcorn is $16 - $2 = $14. So, the regular price of popcorn is $14.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many quarters Jenny leaves with, we first need to calculate the total cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15, 15 roses will cost 15/12 * $15 = $18.75. Jenny pays with five $5 bills, totaling $25. To find the change, we subtract the cost of the roses from the amount she paid: $25 - $18.75 = $6.25. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert $6.25 into quarters. There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so $6.25 is equal to 6 * 4 = 24 quarters. Therefore, Jenny leaves with 24 quarters.<|eot_id|>

To find the total weekly production for the two cashiers, we need to calculate the number of customers each cashier processes in a week. Since Jewel processes 50 customers daily, she processes 50 * 7 = 350 customers in a week. Since Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers daily. Therefore, Julie processes 100 * 7 = 700 customers in a week. The total weekly production for the two cashiers is 350 + 700 = 1050 customers. The answer is 1050.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we first need to calculate the total number of hotdogs that the caterer prepared. Since the caterer prepared enough for half of the guests to have two hotdogs, he prepared 36 / 2 = 18 hotdogs. However, 40 guests showed up, and everyone wanted a second hotdog, so the total number of hotdogs needed is 40 * 2 = 80 hotdogs. Since the caterer only prepared 18 hotdogs, he did not have enough for everyone to get a second hotdog. To find the number of guests who did not get a second hotdog, we subtract the number of hotdogs prepared from the total number of hotdogs needed: 80 - 18 = 62.

To find out how much money Paul spent on driving his car during these two weeks, we need to calculate the total cost of his morning rides and the total cost of his afternoon rides, and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the total cost of his morning rides. Since he drives twice a day for 14 days, the total number of morning rides is 2 x 14 = 28. Each morning ride costs $6, so the total cost of his morning rides is 28 x $6 = $168.

                 Finally, we add the total cost of his morning rides and the total cost of his afternoon rides to find the total amount of money he spent on driving his car during these two weeks. $168 + $56 = $224.

                 2.  Next, we need to find out how many rewards the customer got for this shopping trip. Since they got $1 off for every $20 they spent, and they spent $43, they got 43 / 20 = 2.15 rewards. Since you can't get a fraction of a reward, we round down to 2 rewards.
                 3.  Now, we need to find out how much the rewards are worth. Since they got 2 rewards, and each reward is worth $1, the rewards are worth 2 * 1 = $2.

To find the total amount of money Elise earned in the second year, we first need to determine how many books she sold in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and she has sold 45 books this year, she must have sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.
                 Next, we need to find out how many books she sold in total in the first and second years. We know that she sold 90 books in the first year and 45 books in the second year. So, the total number of books she sold in the first and second years is 90 + 45 = 135.
                 Since she started with 250 books and there are currently 50 unsold books, she must have sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total. We know that she sold 135 books in the first and second years, so the number of books she sold in the third year is 200 - 135 = 65.

To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to first find out how many toys he needs to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set will have 5 x 80 = 400 toys. Since Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, he needs 400 + 2 = 402 toys. To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we need to subtract 2 from 402. 402 - 2 = 400. Therefore, Jonathan currently has 400 toys.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much fence is left over for Sam, we need to first determine how much fence each person gets. Since Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, we can represent the amount of fence Sam gets as "x" and the amount of fence Harry gets as "x + 60". We know that the total amount of fence is 100 feet, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 60) = 100. Solving for x, we get 2x + 60 = 100. Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get 2x = 40. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 20. Therefore, Sam gets 20 feet of fence, and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract the amount of fence he gets from the total amount of fence: 100 - 20 = 80. Therefore, 80 feet of fence is left over for Sam.<|eot_id|>

To find the total age of all the siblings, we first need to determine the age of the older brother. Since one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother, we can calculate the age of the older brother by multiplying the age of the younger brother (12) by 2. The age of the older brother is 12 * 2 = 24 years. Since all the sisters are 16 years old, the total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48 years. To find the total age of all the siblings, we add the age of the older brother (24) and the total age of the sisters (48). The total age of all the siblings is 24 + 48 = 72 years. Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 72 years.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade for 6 hours, we need to calculate his earnings for the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours separately, and then add them together.
First, let's calculate Patrick's earnings for the first 4 hours. He sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.50 per cup. So, his earnings for the first 4 hours are:
15 cups/hour * $0.50/cup = $7.50/hour
$7.50/hour * 4 hours = $30
Next, let's calculate Patrick's earnings for the next 2 hours. He sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour at a price of $0.60 per cup. So, his earnings for the next 2 hours are:
10 cups/hour * $0.60/cup = $6/hour
$6/hour * 2 hours = $12
Now, let's add his earnings for the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours together:
$30 + $12 = $42
Therefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of bags the trader sold, we need to calculate the total cost and total revenue. Let's denote the number of bags as 'x'. The total cost is the sum of the cost of buying the bags and the transportation cost, which is 20x + 2x = 22x. The total revenue is the selling price per bag multiplied by the number of bags sold, which is 30x. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x. We are given that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation 8x = 400 and solve for x. Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 50. Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much James made, we first need to find out how much the company paid for the cars.  The company paid 30% of $25,000.  30% of $25,000 is 0.3 x $25,000 = $7,500.  So the company paid $7,500 for the 10 cars.  To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost from the selling price.  The selling price of the 10 cars is 10 x $25,000 = $250,000.  So the profit is $250,000 - $7,500 = $242,500.  To find James' commission, we need to multiply the profit by 10%.  10% of $242,500 is 0.1 x $242,500 = $24,250.  So James made $24,250.

To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we need to divide the total number of cups of raisins in the bag by the amount of raisins needed for each batch of oatmeal cookies. Since each batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 of a cup of raisins, we will divide 27 cups by 3/4. To divide by a fraction, we can multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction. The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. So, we will multiply 27 cups by 4/3. 27 x 4/3 = 36. Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies. Since she is dividing the raisins equally among the oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix, she can also make 36 batches of granola and 36 batches of snack mix.

To calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we need to calculate the amount paid in May and June separately and then add them together.
In May, the company hired 40 employees and paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. To calculate the total amount paid in May, we multiply the number of employees (40) by the hourly wage ($15) by the number of hours worked per week (40).
40 employees * $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $24,000
In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of the 40 employees left the company. 1/4 of 40 is 10. So, in June, the company had 40 - 10 = 30 employees.
In June, the company paid each employee $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. To calculate the total amount paid in June, we multiply the number of employees (30) by the hourly wage ($15) by the number of hours worked per week (40).

To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole and subtract it from the potential cost of damage to his car. The potential cost of damage to his car is $450. The total cost of fixing the pothole is the cost of 3 buckets of asphalt, which is 3 x $25 = $75, plus the fine of $120. Therefore, the total cost of fixing the pothole is $75 + $120 = $195. To find the amount of money Ron saves, we subtract the total cost of fixing the pothole from the potential cost of damage to his car: $450 - $195 = $255. Therefore, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many centimeters shorter a candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total number of hours the candle burns during this time period.
                 The candle burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, which is a total of 4 hours.
                 Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we can multiply the number of hours it burns by the rate at which it melts:
                 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters
                 Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of beakers that Igor lost, we first need to calculate the total number of items that he was supposed to gather.  Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, for a total of 16 + 7 + 14 = 37 items.  Since Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.  He also gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes.  This means that he gathered a total of 8 + 16 + 7 = 31 items.  Since the total number of items that Igor had placed on the lab bench was 29, he must have lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.  Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers on the way to the lab bench.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week, first calculate the total number of croissants he will make in a week.

Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, it will take 1/4 x 336 = 84 pounds of butter to make 336 croissants.

To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to first calculate the total amount of carrots that will be distributed to the 40 restaurants. Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we multiply the number of restaurants (40) by the amount of carrots each restaurant will receive (2 pounds). This gives us a total of 40 x 2 = 80 pounds of carrots that will be distributed.
                 Since we started with 200 pounds of carrots and 80 pounds will be distributed, we subtract 80 from 200 to find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used. 200 - 80 = 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.

                 Next, let's calculate the total cost of the second amusement park. There are 2 adults and 2 children, so the total cost for the adults is 2 x $14 = $28. The total cost for the children is 2 x $10 = $20. Therefore, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.
                 To find out how much Jake's family will be able to save, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28. Therefore, Jake's family will be able

To find out how many plant pots April has left over, we need to first calculate how many plant pots she needs in total. She needs 30 plant pots for the daisies and twice as many for the roses, so she needs 30 x 2 = 60 plant pots for the roses. In total, she needs 30 + 60 = 90 plant pots. April already had 100 plant pots, so she has 100 - 90 = 10 plant pots left over. The answer is 10.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees for all the cars.
                 First, we calculate the cost of the cars: 12 cars * $20,000 per car = $240,000.
                 Next, we calculate the tax on the cars: 10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000.
                 Then, we calculate the registration fees for all the cars: 12 cars * $1000 per car = $12,000.
                 Finally, we add up the cost of the cars, the tax on the cars, and the registration fees: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

To find out how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to work backwards from the end of the third day. We know that they had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day. On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages and used half a pack. Since each bulk pack contains 50 bandages, they used 50 * 0.5 = 25 bandages on the third day. Therefore, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages at the end of the second day. On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than on the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages on the second day. Therefore, they had 103 + 28 = 131 bandages at the end of the first day. Since they ordered one bulk pack of bandages on the first day, they had 131 + 50 = 181 bandages at the beginning of the first day.

To determine the total number of days Andrew will travel, we need to calculate the number of days for each leg of the trip and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus: 6 days.
Next, we need to calculate the number of days it takes to travel from Rochester back to New Jersey by car. Since it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus, we can divide the number of days by 2: 6 days / 2 = 3 days.
Now, we can add the number of days for each leg of the trip to find the total number of days: 6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days.
Therefore, Andrew will travel for 9 days if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car.<|eot_id|>

Let's denote the number of red chickens as "r" and the number of white chickens as "w". Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can write an equation: w = r + 2. We know that the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so the total number of eggs produced is 3r + 5w. Since Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, we can set up the equation: 3r + 5w = 42. Substituting w = r + 2 into the equation, we get: 3r + 5(r + 2) = 42. Expanding the equation, we get: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42. Combining like terms, we get: 8r + 10 = 42. Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 8r = 32. Dividing both sides by 8, we get: r = 4. Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total price of the house first. The selling price of the house is $350 000. The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price, which is $350 000 * 0.05 = $17 500. The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price, which is $350 000 * 0.12 = $42 000. The total price of the house is the selling price plus the brokerage fee plus the transfer fee, which is $350 000 + $17 500 + $42 000 = $409 500. To find out how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price of the house, which is $409 500 - $400 000 = $9 500.

To determine how long it will take Andy to string all of the racquets, we need to calculate the total time it will take to string each type of racquet and then add those times together.
First, let's calculate the time it will take to string the synthetic gut racquets. There are 3 of them, and it takes 15 minutes to string each one, so the total time is 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.

To find the total time it will take Andy to string all of the racquets, we need to add the times for each type of racquet together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.

## Step 1: Define the variables for the number of eggs painted by each person.
Let's denote the number of eggs painted by Arnold as A, the number of eggs painted by Madeline as M, the number of eggs painted by Camden as C, and the number of eggs painted by Sarah as S.
## Step 2: Set up the equations based on the given information.
We know that Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so A = M.
We also know that Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, so C + S = 30.
Additionally, we know that Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah, so C = S + 12.
## Step 3: Solve the system of equations to find the number of eggs painted by each person.
From the first equation, we can express M in terms of A: M = A.
Substituting M = A into the second equation, we get C + S = 30.
Substituting C = S + 12 into the second equation, we get S + 12 + S = 30.
Combine like terms: 2S + 12 = 30.
Subtract 12 from both sides: 2S = 18.

To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling the candles and subtract the total cost of supplies.
                 First, we need to calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles.  Each candle is sold for $2.00, so the total revenue is 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.
                 Next, we need to calculate the total cost of supplies.  One pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10.00 in supplies.  Since Charlie makes 10 candles per pound of beeswax, he needs 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.  Therefore, the total cost of supplies is 2 x $10.00 = $20.00.
                 Finally, we can calculate Charlie's net profit by subtracting the total cost of supplies from the total revenue.  Net profit = Total revenue - Total cost of supplies = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.

To find the measure of the largest angle in the triangle, we can use the fact that the three angles add up to 180 degrees. Let's call the smallest angle "x". Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, its measure is 2x. Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, its measure is 3x. The sum of these three angles is equal to 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180. Combining like terms, we get 6x = 180. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 30. Now that we know the smallest angle is 30 degrees, we can find the other two angles. The angle that is twice the smallest angle is 2x = 2(30) = 60 degrees. The angle that is three times the smallest angle is 3x = 3(30) = 90 degrees. The largest angle is 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the largest angle in the triangle is 90 degrees.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many bookcases Elly needs, we need to calculate how many books each shelf can hold and then divide the total number of books by the total number of books each bookcase can hold.
                 The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. Since each middle shelf can hold 10 books, the bottom shelf can hold 2 x 10 = 20 books.
                 The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. Since the bottom shelf can hold 20 books, the top shelf can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.
                 Now, let's calculate the total number of books each bookcase can hold. Each middle shelf can hold 10 books, and there are 2 middle shelves, so 2 x 10 = 20 books. The bottom shelf can hold 20 books, and the top shelf can hold 15 books. So, the total number of books each bookcase can hold is 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books.
                 To find out how many bookcases Elly needs, we divide the total number of books (110) by the total number of books each bookcase can hold (55). 110 ÷ 55 = 2

If Isabel is 7 feet tall, then Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Carl is one foot taller than his brother, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.  The answer is 3.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we need to first determine the turtle's speed. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed (15 feet/second) by 5 to find the turtle's speed.
                 15 feet/second ÷ 5 = 3 feet/second
                 Now that we know the turtle's speed (3 feet/second), we can multiply it by the time (40 seconds) to find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.
                 3 feet/second × 40 seconds = 120 feet

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue earned on both days.
                 First, we calculate the total revenue earned on Thursday.  The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.  On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires.  So, the total revenue earned on Thursday is (6 * $60) + (4 * $40) = $360 + $160 = $520.
                 Next, we calculate the total revenue earned on Friday.  The mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire.  On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires.  So, the total revenue earned on Friday is (12 * $40) = $480.
                 To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the total revenue earned on Thursday from the total revenue earned on Friday.  $480 - $520 = -$40.  This means that the mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue.

To determine how much money Susan earns for the online task, we need to calculate the total number of 10-minute intervals she works and then multiply it by her hourly wage.
First, let's calculate the total number of minutes she works. She works from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is 3 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, she works a total of 3 x 60 = 180 minutes.
However, she pauses for half an hour, so we need to subtract 30 minutes from the total time she works. Therefore, she works for 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.
Since she earns $5 every 10 minutes, we can divide the total number of minutes she works by 10 to get the total number of 10-minute intervals. 150 ÷ 10 = 15.
Finally, we can multiply the total number of 10-minute intervals by her hourly wage to get the total amount of money she earns. 15 x $5 = $75.
Therefore, Susan earns $75 for the online task.<|eot_id|>

                 Retirement account: 50% of $2400.00 = 0.5 x $2400.00 = $1200.00
                 Car payment: 20% of $2400.00 = 0.2 x $2400.00 = $480.00
                 Now, we need to subtract the amount she puts into her retirement account and the amount she uses for her car payment from her total paycheck.
                 $2400.00 - $1200.00 = $1200.00
                 $1200.00 - $480.00 = $720.00
                 Therefore, after funding her retirement and paying for her car, Greta has $720.00 left to spend.<|eot_id|>

To find the combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet, we need to calculate the number of times she taps each foot separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of times Helga taps each foot when her arms are down.  She taps her right foot 300 times per minute and her left foot 250 times per minute, for a total of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  Since she dances for 5 minutes with her arms down, she taps her feet a total of 550 * 5 = 2750 times.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of times Helga taps each foot when her arms are up.  She taps her right foot 200 times per minute and her left foot 200 times per minute, for a total of 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  Since she dances for 2 minutes with her arms up, she taps her feet a total of 400 * 2 = 800 times.
                 Finally, we add the number of times Helga taps her feet when her arms are down to the number of times she taps her feet when her arms are up.  2750 + 800 =

To determine how long it took James to reach the store, we need to calculate the time it took him to walk to the store and the time it took him to walk back home.  The distance to the store is 4 miles and he walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour.  Therefore, the time it took him to walk to the store is 4 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1 hour.  Since he had to walk back home, the total distance is 4 miles + 4 miles = 8 miles.  The time it took him to walk back home is 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.  Therefore, the total time it took James to reach the store is 1 hour + 2 hours = 3 hours.  The answer is 3 hours.<|eot_id|>

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, and she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so Jenna has 3 x 22 = 66 chairs. The total number of chairs is 22 + 66 = 88. The total number of sofas is 20 + 20 = 40. Therefore, the total number of sofas and chairs that they have is 88 + 40 = 128. The answer is 128.<|eot_id|>

To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in the house, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Find the number of corns Allan has in his house. Since there is twice as much corn as cannolis, we can multiply the number of cannolis by 2 to find the number of corns.
Number of cannolis = 40
Number of corns = 2 * Number of cannolis
Number of corns = 2 * 40
Number of corns = 80
Step 2: Find the number of cannolis Allan bought at the store.
Number of cannolis bought = 60
Step 3: Find the total number of cannolis Allan has now.
Total number of cannolis = Initial number of cannolis + Number of cannolis bought
Total number of cannolis = 40 + 60
Total number of cannolis = 100
Step 4: Find the number of corns Allan bought at the store. Since he bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis, we can subtract 40 from the total number of cannolis.
Number of corns bought = Total number of cannolis - 40
Number of corns bought

Carrie was given ten twenties and 140 quarters by her aunt to use for lunch. If she spent all the quarters and 3/5 of the twenties, we need to calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch.
                 First, we need to calculate the amount of money she spent from the quarters. Since there are 140 quarters and each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money she spent from the quarters is 140 x $0.25 = $35.
                 Next, we need to calculate the amount of money she spent from the twenties. Since there are ten twenties and she spent 3/5 of them, the number of twenties she spent is 3/5 x 10 = 6. Since each twenty is worth $20, the total amount of money she spent from the twenties is 6 x $20 = $120.
                 Finally, we need to calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch by adding the amount of money she spent from the quarters and the amount of money she spent from the twenties. Therefore, the total amount of money she paid for the lunch is $35 + $120 = $155.

To find out how much Bennet should sell each ear of corn for, we first need to calculate how much money he made from selling the eggplants. He sold 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he made 20 x $3 = $60 from eggplants.
                 Since Bennet wants to make a total of $135 and he made $60 from eggplants, he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 from selling the 25 ears of corn.
                 To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we need to divide the amount of money he needs to make from corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn (25). $75 ÷ 25 = $3.

To find out how much land Mr. Ruther had at first, we need to divide the amount of land he has left (12.8 hectares) by the fraction of land he sold (3/5). To do this, we can multiply 12.8 by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3.
                 12.8 * (5/3) = 21.33 hectares
                 Therefore, Mr. Ruther had 21.33 hectares of land at first.
                 Alternatively, we can convert the fraction 3/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator: 3 ÷ 5 = 0.6. Then, we can divide 12.8 by 0.6 to find the original amount of land.
                 12.8 ÷ 0.6 = 21.33 hectares

To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we first need to determine the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class for lunch. We know that there were 50 cars initially, and 20 more cars arrived during the first break. So, the total number of cars in the parking lot when Hunter got out of class is 50 + 20 = 70. Then, we are told that 1/2 of the number of cars in the parking lot had gone. To find 1/2 of 70, we multiply 70 by 1/2, which is the same as multiplying 70 by 0.5. 70 * 0.5 = 35. This means that 35 cars left the parking lot during the lunch break. To find the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars in the parking lot when he got out of class. So, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 70 - 35 = 35. Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars during the lunch break.<|eot_id|>

To determine the angle from the ground to the sun after 10 hours, we need to calculate the change in angle of the sun's position relative to Sahir's house and add it to the initial angle of 32 degrees.
                 The sun moves 5 degrees an hour, so in 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.
                 Since the sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, the angle from the ground to the sun will be the initial angle of 32 degrees plus the change in angle due to the sun's movement, which is 50 degrees.

To calculate the total number of insects in the garden, we first need to determine the number of bugs. Since there are half as many bugs as ants, we can calculate the number of bugs by dividing the number of ants by 2.
                 Number of bugs = Number of ants / 2
                 Number of bugs = 50 / 2
                 Number of bugs = 25
                 To find the total number of insects, we need to add the number of bugs and the number of ants.
                 Total number of insects = Number of bugs + Number of ants
                 Total number of insects = 25 + 50
                 Total number of insects = 75
                 Therefore, the total number of insects in the garden is 75.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we need to work backwards from the 5 vacuum cleaners she has left. We know that she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, she must have had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners at the orange house. At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she must have had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners at the red house. At the green house, she sold a third of her vacuum cleaners, so she must have had 12 * 3 = 36 vacuum cleaners at the green house. Therefore, Melanie started with 36 + 12 + 10 + 5 = 63 vacuum cleaners. The answer is 63.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate Dora's father's age
Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, her father's age is 2 x 15 + 8 = 38.
Step 2: Calculate Dora's mother's age
Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Since Dora's father is 38 years old, Dora's mother is 38 - 4 = 34 years old.
Step 3: Calculate the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother
The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 15 (Dora's age) + 38 (Dora's father's age) + 34 (Dora's mother's age) = 87.
Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.<|eot_id|>

To find the final temperature of Marcus's house, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase due to baking.
Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and every hour the oven is on it raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees. So, the total temperature increase due to baking is 3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.
Step 2: Calculate the final temperature after baking.
The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees. After baking, the temperature increases by 15 degrees. So, the final temperature after baking is 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees.
Step 3: Calculate the temperature decrease due to opening the window.
Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since 30 minutes is 3 times 10 minutes, the total temperature decrease due to opening the window is 3 * 2 degrees = 6 degrees.
Step 4: Calculate the final temperature after opening the window.
The final temperature after baking is 55 degrees. After opening the window, the temperature decreases by 6 degrees. So, the final temperature of the house is 55 degrees -

To find out how much money Kate can make, we need to find out how many muffin crayons she can make with the 3 boxes of crayons.  Each box has 64 crayons, so 3 boxes have 3 x 64 = 192 crayons.  Since each muffin uses 8 crayons, we can divide 192 by 8 to find out how many muffin crayons Kate can make.  192 ÷ 8 = 24 muffin crayons.  Since each muffin crayon sells for $1.50, we can multiply 24 by $1.50 to find out how much money Kate can make.  24 x $1.50 = $36.  Therefore, Kate can make $36 by selling her muffin crayons.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it would take Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school, we need to calculate the total amount of money he lost while in school and the total amount of money he needs to earn to pay off the loans.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in school.  Since it takes him 4 years to finish college and he had a $25,000 a year job before college, the total amount of money he lost is 4 x $25,000 = $100,000.
                 Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans.  Since he gets $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years, the total amount of money he needs to earn is 4 x $50,000 = $200,000.
                 Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim needs to earn to pay off the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.  This is the sum of the total amount of money he needs to earn to pay off the loans and the total amount of money he lost while in school, which is $200,000 + $100,000 =

## Step 1: Calculate the initial number of apples Beck has
Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris, who has 100 apples. So, Beck initially has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.
## Step 2: Calculate the number of apples Beck has after receiving apples from Boris
Boris gives Beck 10 apples. So, Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.
## Step 3: Calculate the difference in the number of apples Beck and Boris have now
Boris still has 100 apples. Beck now has 87 apples. The difference is 100 - 87 = 13 apples.
The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$<|eot_id|>

To calculate the amount of money Ali has after buying dinner, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has.
Ali has 4 x $10 = $40 from the $10 bills.
Ali has 6 x $20 = $120 from the $20 bills.
The total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $160.
Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Ali gives to his sister.
Ali gives his sister half of the total money he has, which is 1/2 x $160 = $80.
Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Ali has left after giving his sister half of the money.
The amount of money Ali has left is $160 - $80 = $80.
Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Ali uses to buy dinner.
Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner, which is 3/5 x $80 = $48.
Step 5: Calculate the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner.
The amount of money Ali has left is $80 - $48 = $32.

To find the total weight of the crayons and the boxes, we first need to determine how many boxes Nik will need.

To find the volume of the pool, we need to multiply the width, length, and depth of the pool. The width is 14 feet, the length is 25 feet, and the depth is 4 feet. So, the volume of the pool is 14 x 25 x 4 = 1400 cubic feet. To convert cubic feet to gallons, we need to know that 1 cubic foot is equal to 7.48 gallons. Therefore, the volume of the pool in gallons is 1400 x 7.48 = 10472 gallons. To find the cost of filling the pool, we need to multiply the volume of the pool in gallons by the cost per gallon, which is $0.10.

To find the profit John makes on his car, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earns from renting out his car and then subtract his car payment.
First, we need to calculate the total amount of money John earns from renting out his car. He rents out his car 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, so the total number of hours he rents out his car is 10 x 3 = 30 hours. Since he gets paid $25 an hour, the total amount of money he earns is 30 x $25 = $750.
Next, we need to subtract his car payment from the total amount of money he earns. His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $250.
Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car.<|eot_id|>

First, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes. Since Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, we can divide 60 by 2 to find the number of socks he has: 60 / 2 = 30 socks.
Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can multiply the number of socks Jack has by 2 to find the number of socks Peter has: 30 * 2 = 60 socks.
We also know that Peter has half as many dishes as Jack. Since Jack has 60 dishes, we can divide 60 by 2 to find the number of dishes Peter has: 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.
Now that we know the number of socks and dishes each of them has, we can add them together to find the total number of socks and dishes they have together: 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 60 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 180.
Therefore, Peter and Jack have a total of 180 socks and dishes together.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we first need to determine the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2. This gives us 60 * 2 = 120 cats. Next, we add the number of dogs (60) to the number of cats (120) to find the combined number of dogs and cats. The combined number of dogs and cats is 60 + 120 = 180. Since the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats, we subtract 12 from 180 to find the number of rabbits. This gives us 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits. Finally, we add the number of dogs (60), cats (120), and rabbits (168) to find the total number of pets in the neighborhood. The total number of pets is 60 + 120 + 168 = 348. Therefore, there are 348 pets in the neighborhood.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total amount of money used, we need to calculate the amount of time each person played and then multiply that by the cost per game.
                 Jack played for 4 hours, which is equivalent to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.  Since he can play for 20 minutes per quarter, he used 240 / 20 = 12 quarters.

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to find the percentage chance that he won't get an extension. There are three scenarios in which Marcus won't have to turn in his homework: (1) the normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, (2) the substitute teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension, and (3) Marcus can't convince the teacher that his dog ate his assignment. We can calculate the percentage chance of each scenario and add them together to find the total percentage chance that Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.
                 Scenario 1: The normal teacher comes in and doesn't give an extension. The probability of this happening is 100% - 40% = 60%.

To find the percentage more that the factory is making per day now, we need to first find the difference in the amount of money they make per day now compared to when they made tractors. We can do this by subtracting the amount of money they made per day when they made tractors from the amount of money they make per day now.
                 The amount of money they made per day when they made tractors is 10 tractors * $100 per tractor = $1000 per day.
                 The amount of money they make per day now is 5 silos * $220 per silo = $1100 per day.
                 The difference in the amount of money they make per day now compared to when they made tractors is $1100 per day - $1000 per day = $100 per day.
                 To find the percentage more that the factory is making per day now, we need to divide the difference in the amount of money they make per day now by the amount of money they made per day when they made tractors, and multiply by 100.

To determine how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we first need to calculate the total amount of rice consumed by the household every day. Since each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal and there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed by the household every meal is 5 * 0.2 = 1 kg. Since the household eats rice every lunch and dinner, the total amount of rice consumed by the household every day is 1 * 2 = 2 kg. To find out how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the total amount of rice in the bag by the amount of rice consumed by the household every day, which is 42 / 2 = 21 days. To find out how many weeks a 42 kg bag of rice will last, we divide the number of days by 7, which is 21 / 7 = 3 weeks. Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we need to calculate the cost of 5 apples and the cost of 5 oranges separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the cost of 5 apples. Since 4 apples cost $5.20, we can find the cost of 1 apple by dividing $5.20 by 4, which is $1.30. To find the cost of 5 apples, we multiply $1.30 by 5, which is $6.50.
Next, let's calculate the cost of 5 oranges. Since 3 oranges cost $3.30, we can find the cost of 1 orange by dividing $3.30 by 3, which is $1.10. To find the cost of 5 oranges, we multiply $1.10 by 5, which is $5.50.
Finally, we add the cost of 5 apples ($6.50) and the cost of 5 oranges ($5.50) together to find the total cost. $6.50 + $5.50 = $12.00.
Therefore, Clyde will pay $12.00 for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we need to calculate the cost of the pomegranates on both days and then subtract the cost of the pomegranates on the first day from the cost of the pomegranates on the second day.
First, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates on the first day. Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each, so the total cost is 20 x $20 = $400. However, she got $2 off because she had a voucher, so the final cost is $400 - $2 = $398.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the pomegranates on the second day. Sheila bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, so the total cost is 20 x $30 = $600. The store offered a 10% discount on the total cost, so the discount amount is 10% of $600, which is 0.1 x $600 = $60. Therefore, the final cost is $600 - $60 = $540.

To find out how much more money Billy will earn than Sally, we need to first calculate how much each of them will earn in 20 hours.  Billy's hourly wage is $10 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.  Sally's hourly wage is $0.50 + $11.50 = $12.00.  Billy will earn $11.50 * 20 = $230.00.  Sally will earn $12.00 * 20 = $240.00.  Therefore, Billy will earn $240.00 - $230.00 = $10.00 more than Sally.  The answer is $10.00.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost, we need to set up an equation.  Let x be the number of guests.  The total cost of the first venue is $200 + $5x.  The total cost of the second venue is $25x.  Since we want the two venues to be equal in cost, we can set up the equation 200 + 5x = 25x.  Subtracting 5x from both sides, we get 200 = 20x.  Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 10.  Therefore, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long the winner will be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home and then find the difference between the two times.
                 First, we need to convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile, so Steve's distance is 3 x 5280 = 15,840 feet and Tim's distance is 2 x 5280 = 10,560 feet.
                 Next, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to get home. We can do this by dividing the distance by the speed. For Steve, the time is 15,840 / 440 = 36 minutes. For Tim, the time is 10,560 / 264 = 40 minutes.
                 Since Steve takes 36 minutes to get home and Tim takes 40 minutes, the winner will be waiting for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.
                 Therefore, the winner will be waiting 4 minutes at their house before the loser finishes the race.<|eot_id|>

To find the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we first need to determine how many hours she spends playing soccer. She has 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, for a total of 12 hours. She reads for 3 hours, leaving 12 - 3 = 9 hours for soccer and video games. Since she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, she spends 1/3 * 9 = 3 hours playing video games. Therefore, she spends 9 - 3 = 6 hours playing soccer. To find the percentage of her weekend that she spends playing soccer, we divide the number of hours she spends playing soccer (6) by the total number of hours in her weekend (12) and multiply by 100. This gives us (6/12) * 100 = 50%. Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours, we first need to calculate her running and walking speeds. Since Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour and her skipping speed is half of her running speed, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. Her walking speed is four times slower than her running speed, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
Next, we need to determine how much time Dana spends running and walking. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can calculate the time she spends running as (1/3) * 6 hours = 2 hours and the time she spends walking as (2/3) * 6 hours = 4 hours.
Now, we can calculate the total distance Dana can travel by adding the distance she travels while running and the distance she travels while walking. The distance she travels while running is 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles, and the distance she travels while walking is 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = 6 miles. Therefore, the total distance Dana can travel in six hours is 12 + 6 =

To find out how many pints of red paint were used, we first need to determine the total amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple sections of the mural. Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, let's call the amount of paint used for each of these colors "x". The total amount of paint used for the red, white, and purple sections is then 3x. Since half the mural is yellow, the amount of paint used for the yellow section is half of the total amount of paint used, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pints. The total amount of paint used is the sum of the paint used for the red, white, and purple sections and the paint used for the yellow section, which is 3x + 6. Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can set up the equation 3x + 6 = 12 and solve for x. Subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 2. Since x represents the amount of paint used for each of the red, white, and purple

To determine the total number of toys James needs, let's break down the problem step by step.
                 Initially, James had 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means he had 1 toy per dog. Since there are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, he needs 8 more toys. So, he now needs a total of 4 (initial toys) + 8 (additional toys) = 12 toys.
                 However, when James came back, he found that there were twice as many dogs as when he left. This means there are now 2 * 8 = 16 dogs. Since each dog needs one toy, James now needs 16 toys in total.
                 Finally, when James came back again, 3 dogs were gone. This means he no longer needs 3 toys. So, he now needs 16 (total toys needed) - 3 (toys no longer needed) = 13 toys.
                 Therefore, James needs a total of 13 toys for the doggie shelter.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money John makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of apartments he collects garbage from and multiply it by the amount he gets paid per collection.
                 First, we need to find the total number of apartments in the last complex.  Since it is 60% bigger than the other two combined, we need to find the total number of apartments in the first two complexes.  The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 + 200 = 400.

To find out how much each of the books cost, we need to first find out how much money Anna spent on the books. We know that she had a budget of $16 and spent $4, so she has $16 - $4 = $12 left. Since she has $2 left in her budget, she must have spent $12 - $2 = $10 on the books. We know that she bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount of money, so we can divide $10 by 2 to find the cost of each book. $10 ÷ 2 = $5. Therefore, each of the books cost $5.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many math problems Chris has left to complete on Thursday, we need to calculate the number of problems he completed each day and subtract that from the total number of problems.
                 On Monday, Chris completed 12 math problems.
                 On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36 problems.
                 So far, Chris has completed 12 + 36 = 48 math problems.
                 On Wednesday, he completed one-quarter of the remaining math problems. The remaining problems are 100 - 48 = 52. One-quarter of 52 is 52 / 4 = 13 problems.
                 Therefore, Chris has completed 48 + 13 = 61 math problems.
                 To find out how many math problems he has left to complete on Thursday, we need to subtract the number of problems he has completed from the total number of problems. 100 - 61 = 39.
                 Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.<|eot_id|>

To calculate Josh's profit, we first need to determine the value of the house after the repairs.  If the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, then the value of the house after the repairs is 2.5 times the original value.  The original value of the house was $80,000, so the value of the house after the repairs is 2.5 x $80,000 = $200,000.  Josh spent $50,000 on repairs, so his profit is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.  Therefore, Josh made a profit of $70,000.<|eot_id|>

To find the amount of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters, we need to subtract 90 liters from the initial amount of 120 liters.

To determine how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month, we need to calculate the number of each type of bike sold and then multiply that number by the price of each type of bike.
First, let's calculate the number of Trekking bikes sold. Since half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, the number of Trekking bikes sold is 300 / 2 = 150.
Next, let's calculate the number of BMX bikes sold. Since 15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes, the number of BMX bikes sold is 300 x 0.15 = 45.
Now, let's calculate the number of MTB bikes sold. Since the rest of the bikes sold were MTB bikes, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - (150 + 45) = 105.
Now that we know the number of each type of bike sold, we can calculate the total amount of money Marcel earned from selling bicycles during that month. The total amount of money earned from selling Trekking bikes is 150 x $450 = $67,500. The total amount of money earned from selling BMX bikes is 45 x $250 = $11,250. The total amount of money

To calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we first need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, so the total number of parts is 7 + 13 = 20. Since the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons, we can divide 120 by the total number of parts (20) to find the value of one part. 120 ÷ 20 = 6. This means that each part of the ratio is equal to 6 teaspoons. To find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used, we multiply the number of parts of sugar (7) by the value of one part (6). 7 x 6 = 42. Therefore, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to reach his goal, we first need to calculate the number of days he has until his birthday. Since today is December 31st and his birthday is July 19th, we can calculate the number of days as follows:
                 December has 31 days, January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming a non-leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. Therefore, the total number of days is:
                 31 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 231 days
                 Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, and he wants to lose 30 lbs, he needs to burn a total of 3500 x 30 = 105,000 calories. To calculate the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to be burned by the number of days:
                 105,000 calories / 231 days = approximately 453 calories per day
                 Therefore, Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of approximately 453 calories to reach his goal of

To find out how much material Jo would need, we need to calculate the amount of material required for the small and large masks separately and then add them together.
                 For the small masks, Jo needs 2 yards of material for each mask. Since she wants to make 20 small masks, she will need 20 x 2 = 40 yards of material.
                 For the large masks, Jo needs 2.25 yards of material for each mask. Since she wants to make 8 large masks, she will need 8 x 2.25 = 18 yards of material.
                 To find the total amount of material needed, we add the material required for the small and large masks: 40 + 18 = 58 yards of material.

To find the total amount of money in Brady's piggy bank, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and bill, and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the value of the pennies. There are 100 pennies, and each penny is worth $0.01. So, the total value of the pennies is 100 x $0.01 = $1.00.
                 Next, let's calculate the value of the nickels. There are 40 nickels, and each nickel is worth $0.05. So, the total value of the nickels is 40 x $0.05 = $2.00.
                 Then, let's calculate the value of the dimes. There are 20 dimes, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, the total value of the dimes is 20 x $0.10 = $2.00.
                 Finally, let's calculate the value of the dollar bills. There are 40 dollar bills, and each dollar bill is worth $1.00. So, the total value of the dollar bills is 40 x $1.00 = $40.00.

To find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it, we need to work backwards from the number of fries that were left behind. We know that five fries were left behind, so we can start by adding the fries that were carried off by the ants, the fries that were stolen by the raccoon, the fries that were eaten by the pigeons, and the fries that were eaten by the seagull.
                 First, let's add the fries that were eaten by the seagull. Since the seagull ate half of what Dave ate, and Dave ate 14 fries, the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
                 Next, let's add the fries that were eaten by the pigeons. Since each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, the pigeons ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries.
                 Now, let's add the fries that were stolen by the raccoon. Since the raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, and there were 5 fries left, the raccoon stole 2/3 x 5 = 3.33 fries (round down to 3, since we can't have a fraction of a french fry

To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed and divide it by the number of days.
                 Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs on each of those days.  The total number of Junebugs she removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 + 78 = 156.  On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.  The total number of Junebugs she removed is 39 + 156 + 48 + 57 = 300.
                 There are 5 days in the week.  To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs she removed (300) by the number of days (5).  The average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is 300 / 5 = 60.

To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we first need to calculate the total number of fireworks set off in the city. Since there are 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each, the total number of fireworks set off in the city is 15 * 20 = 300.
                 Since Hannah's house is at the right angle to see 40% of the city's fireworks, we need to find 40% of 300. To do this, we multiply 300 by 0.4. 300 * 0.4 = 120.
                 Next, we need to calculate the total number of fireworks Hannah will set off in her backyard. Since she will set off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each, the total number of fireworks set off in her backyard is 3 * 5 = 15.
                 To find the total number of fireworks Hannah will see, we need to add the number of fireworks she will see from the city (120) and the number of fireworks she will set off in her backyard (15). 120 + 15 = 135.

To find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we first need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans. Since the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, and the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, and he saved a total of $6, he saved 1/3 * $6 = $2 from the jogger jeans and $6 - $2 = $4 from the tattered jeans. The original price of the jogger jeans is $22 + $2 = $24. The original price of the tattered jeans is $28 + $4 = $32. Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $24 - $22 = $2 more than the tattered jeans. The answer is $2.<|eot_id|>

To determine the initial number of grapes, we need to work backwards from the information given. Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline, so he used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes. In total, Madeline and her brother used 6 + 30 = 36 grapes. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. Since each pie requires 12 grapes, the total number of grapes used for the pies is 4 * 12 = 48 grapes. This means that there were 48 + 36 = 84 grapes at the beginning. Therefore, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total weight of a container carrying one of each animal, we first need to determine the weight of each animal. We are given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds. Since the pink frog weighs the same as a blue beetle, the blue beetle also weighs 50 pounds. The green toad weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds. The yellow snake weighs 10 pounds more than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 + 10 = 60 pounds. The red bird weighs 20 pounds less than the pink frog, so it weighs 50 - 20 = 30 pounds.
                 Now that we know the weight of each animal, we can calculate the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal. The total weight is the sum of the weights of the pink frog, blue beetle, green toad, yellow snake, and red bird, which is 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 pounds. Since the container also weighs 20 pounds, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 240 + 20 = 260 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Determine the current age of Noah
Cera is currently 46 years old, and six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, six years ago, Noah was 46 / 2 = 23 years old.
## Step 2: Calculate the population of Chile six years ago
The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Since Noah was 23 years old six years ago, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 23 = 69,000.
## Step 3: Calculate the current population of Chile
The population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 2 * 69,000 = 138,000.

To find out how many small stuffed animals Teresa sold, we first need to determine the price of a large stuffed animal. Since she sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, and each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 * $4 = $12.
Next, we know that she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. If we let x be the number of large stuffed animals sold, then the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.
Since she earned $120 from the sales, we can set up the equation 2x * $4 + x * $12 = $120. This equation represents the total earnings from the sales of small and large stuffed animals.
Simplifying the equation, we get 8x + 12x = 120. Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120. Dividing both sides by 20, we get x = 6.
Since x represents the number of large stuffed animals sold, and the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2 * 6 = 12.
Therefore, Teresa sold 12 small

## Step 1: Calculate Maggie's initial amount of money
Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which means she has 3/4 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can represent this as 3/4 * 60 = 45.
## Step 2: Calculate Riza's initial amount of money
Riza spent one-third of her money, which means she has 2/3 of her money left. Since she had $60, we can represent this as 2/3 * 60 = 40.
## Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money they have left
To find the total amount of money they have left, we need to add Maggie's remaining money and Riza's remaining money. So, 45 + 40 = 85.

To find out how much Tanya earned for these two days of teaching, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then add them together.
                 On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 for every hour, her earnings for Monday will be 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Additionally, she teaches more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Monday will be $75 + $5 = $80.
                 On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. Since she earns $15 for every hour, her earnings for Wednesday will be 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Again, she teaches more than 3 classes, so she earns an extra $5 per day. Therefore, her total earnings for Wednesday will be $30 + $5 = $35.

To find out how much change the cashier gives back, we need to calculate the total cost of the items the mother bought. We can do this by adding the cost of the cocoa, laundry, and pasta.
                 Total cost = cost of cocoa + cost of laundry + cost of pasta
                 Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35
                 Total cost = $14.99 + $1.35
                 Total cost = $16.34
                 Now that we know the total cost, we can find out how much change the cashier gives back by subtracting the total cost from the amount the mother paid.
                 Change = amount paid - total cost
                 Change = $20 - $16.34
                 Change = $3.66
                 Therefore, the cashier gives the mother $3.66 in change.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of roses each flower shop orders per week by 4.
                 The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month, it orders 20 x 4 = 80 roses.
                 The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month, it orders 15 x 4 = 60 roses.
                 The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month, it orders 30 x 4 = 120 roses.
                 The total number of roses the flower shops order in a month is 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses.
                 Since Ford grows 40 roses every week, in a month, he grows 40 x 4 = 160 roses.
                 To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we subtract the number of roses he grows in a month from the total number of roses the flower shops order in a month.

To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes. Since 80% of the water used by the city is used for industrial purposes, we can find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for industrial purposes by multiplying 40% (the percent of the river's total water used by the city) by 80% (the percent of the water used by the city for industrial purposes). This gives us 0.4 x 0.8 = 0.32, or 32%. Therefore, 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes. To find the percent of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we can subtract 32% from 40%. This gives us 40% - 32% = 8%. Therefore, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. The answer is 8%.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of sheep on Lee's farm, we need to use the information about the total number of animal heads and the total number of animal legs. Since each sheep has 1 head and 4 legs, and each goose has 1 head and 2 legs, we can set up a system of linear equations to solve for the number of sheep and geese.
Let's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We know that the total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write the equation:
S + G = 20
We also know that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs, we can write the equation:
4S + 2G = 70
We can simplify the second equation by dividing both sides by 2:
2S + G = 35
Now we have two equations:
S + G = 20
2S + G = 35
We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate G:
(2S + G) - (S + G) = 35 - 20
S = 15
So, the number of sheep on Lee's farm

To calculate the profit made by the hospital from these visits, we need to first calculate the total time spent by the doctors on each patient.  Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, the time spent by the doctors on each patient is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.  Since the hospital sees 500 people a day, the total time spent by the doctors on all patients is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.  Since the doctors charge $150 an hour to the hospital, the total amount paid by the hospital to the doctors is 200 * 150 = $30,000.  Since the hospital charges the patients $200 an hour, the total amount charged by the hospital to the patients is 200 * 500 = $100,000.  Therefore, the profit made by the hospital from these visits is $100,000 - $30,000 = $70,000.  The hospital makes a profit of $70,000 from these visits.<|eot_id|>

                 Then, 3/5 of the remaining 700 students went out through exit B. 3/5 of 700 is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.
                 So, the number of students who went out through exit B is 420.
                 The number of students who went out through exit C is the remaining students after exit B, which is 700 - 420 = 280 students.
                 Therefore, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280.<|eot_id|>

To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.
First, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week. We know that he runs 60 miles a week.
Next, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week. We know that he runs 3 hours on the first day and half as much (1.5 hours) on the other two days. So, the total time he spends running in a week is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.
Now, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance he runs in a week (60 miles) by the total time he spends running in a week (6 hours).
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 60 miles / 6 hours
Speed = 10 miles per hour
Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many miles John drives a month when visiting his parents, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip and multiply it by the number of times he visits his parents in a month.
                 First, we need to calculate the distance of the round trip.  Since it takes John 2 hours to drive to his parents at a speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula: distance = speed * time.
                 distance = 70 mph * 2 hours
                 distance = 140 miles
                 Since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply the distance of the round trip by 2.
                 total distance = 140 miles * 2
                 total distance = 280 miles
                 Therefore, John drives 280 miles a month when visiting his parents.<|eot_id|>

To find Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour, we need to first convert her speed from kb per second to Mb per second. Since 1 Mb has 1000 kb, we can divide her speed of 20 kb per second by 1000 to get her speed in Mb per second.
                 20 kb per second ÷ 1000 = 0.02 Mb per second
                 Next, we need to convert her speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute and 60 minutes in 1 hour, we can multiply her speed in Mb per second by 60 to get her speed in Mb per hour.
                 0.02 Mb per second × 60 seconds per minute = 1.2 Mb per minute
                 1.2 Mb per minute × 60 minutes per hour = 72 Mb per hour

To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to find the time it takes for Tom to cover the distance between them. Since Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour, the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.
                 To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up, we can divide the distance between them (75 miles) by the relative speed (15 miles per hour).
                 Time = Distance / Relative Speed
                 Time = 75 miles / 15 miles per hour
                 Time = 5 hours

To find out how much money Erika has in her purse, we need to calculate the total amount of money she has available to buy the laptop. We know that the price of the laptop will be reduced by $200 if she trades in her old laptop. So, the new price of the laptop will be $600 - $200 = $400. We also know that she has some savings in her purse, $150 from her part-time job, and $80 from her mom. Since she only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, the total amount of money she has available is $400 + $150 + $80 = $630. To find out how much money she has in her purse, we need to subtract the amount she received from her mom and her part-time job from the total amount of money she has available. So, the amount of money she has in her purse is $630 - $150 - $80 = $400. Therefore, Erika has $400 in her purse.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Define variables for Wendy's and Colin's current ages
Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.
## Step 2: Translate the given information into equations
From the problem, we have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now: W = 5(C + 7)
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now: C + 25 = (1/3)W
## Step 3: Solve the system of equations
We can substitute the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:
C + 25 = (1/3)(5(C + 7))
## Step 4: Simplify and solve for C
Expanding the equation gives:
C + 25 = (5/3)C + (35/3)
Multiplying every term by 3 to clear the fractions gives:
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
Subtracting 3C from both sides gives:
75 = 2C + 35
Subtracting 35 from both sides gives:

She now has 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 large stickers is 0.5 x 40 = 20 large stickers. She now has 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers. She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons. 20 large stickers is equivalent to 20 x 3 = 60 small stickers. She now has 3 + 60 = 63 small stickers.

To find out how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to calculate the total amount of meat he sells in a day.

To find out how many books Fawn has, we need to start with the total number of books, which is 85. We know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, and Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. Let's use variables to represent the number of books each person has. Let S be the number of books Sofie has, A be the number of books Anne has, and F be the number of books Fawn has. We can write the following equations based on the given information: S = A + 25 and A = F - 12. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get S = (F - 12) + 25. Simplifying this equation, we get S = F + 13. Since the total number of books is 85, we can write the equation S + A + F = 85. Substituting S = F + 13 and A = F - 12 into this equation, we get (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85. Combining like terms, we get 3F + 1 = 85. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 3F =

In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. Since Brett is 14 years old now, in four years he will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old. Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now, so Angela will be 3 x 14 = 42 years old in four years. To find Angela's current age, subtract 4 from 42. 42 - 4 = 38. Angela is currently 38 years old. The answer is 38.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of employees who oversee the company, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of management employees.
                 First, we need to find the total number of management employees. 20% of 50 employees is 0.2 x 50 = 10 employees.
                 Now, we need to find 30% of 10 employees. 30% of 10 employees is 0.3 x 10 = 3 employees.
                 Therefore, there are 3 employees who oversee the entire company.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Dean has left, we need to first calculate the total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears. The total cost of the toy cars is 6 x $2 = $12. The total cost of the teddy bears is 5 x $1 = $5. The total cost of the toy cars and teddy bears is $12 + $5 = $17. Since Dean started with $28 and spent $17, he has $28 - $17 = $11 left. After his mother gives him an extra $10, Dean now has $11 + $10 = $21. The answer is $21.<|eot_id|>

In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. In the next 30 seconds, three times that amount popped, which is 3 * 20 = 60 kernels. In the final 30 seconds, four times the initial popping rate popped, which is 4 * 20 = 80 kernels. In the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds, which is 80 / 2 = 40 kernels. After Garrett takes the pan off the heat, a quarter of the number of kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds of cooking also pop from the residual heat, which is 1/4 * 40 = 10 kernels. The total number of kernels that popped is 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels. Garrett has to eat 210 pieces of popcorn. The answer is 210.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much Tom has to pay per month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate the total cost of the bedroom set after he uses the money from the sale of his old bedroom to pay for part of it.
                 The bedroom set originally costs $3000.  Tom sells his old bedroom for $1000, which he uses to pay for part of the bedroom set.  So, the remaining cost of the bedroom set is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.
                 Since Tom has to pay 10% a month for the bedroom set, we need to calculate 10% of $2000.
                 10% of $2000 = 0.10 x $2000 = $200

                 "Deck the Halls" is 150 seconds long, so it will take 2 x 150 = 300 seconds to sing it twice.
                 "Jingle Bells" is 240 seconds long, so it will take 1 x 240 = 240 seconds to sing it once.

To determine the total cost of the potting soil, we need to calculate the total volume of the raised beds. Since each bed is 2 feet wide by 8 feet long by 2 feet tall, the volume of each bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet. Since Bob has 10 raised beds, the total volume of the raised beds is 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet. Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet, the total number of bags needed is 320 / 2 = 160 bags. Since each bag costs $12, the total cost of the potting soil is 160 x $12 = $1920. Therefore, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many passengers are riding the bus after the second stop, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.
                 Initially, there are 48 passengers on the bus.
                 At the first stop, 8 passengers get off. This leaves 48 - 8 = 40 passengers on the bus.
                 Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, 5 * 8 = 40 passengers get on the bus. Now, there are 40 + 40 = 80 passengers on the bus.
                 At the second stop, 21 passengers get off. This leaves 80 - 21 = 59 passengers on the bus.
                 Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on the bus compared to the number who got off (21). So, 21 / 3 = 7 passengers get on the bus. Now, there are 59 + 7 = 66 passengers on the bus.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. This means he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 10 - 4 = 6 boxes of apple pie. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, which is 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. He also sold 15 boxes of apple pie on Sunday. The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold over the two days is 10 + 15 = 25. The total number of boxes of apple pie sold over the two days is 6 + 15 = 21. The total amount of money earned from gingerbread is 25 x $6 = $150. The total amount of money earned from apple pie is 21 x $15 = $315.

                 The total score of the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

                 The lowest score among the first five tests is 71.
                 To get an average of 93, the total score of the six tests must be 93 * 6 = 558.
                 Since Brinley can remove the lowest score from the average, we need to subtract the lowest score from the total score.
                 The new total score is 558 - 71 = 487.

To find out how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we need to calculate the profit made by each student and then multiply it by the total number of students.
                 First, let's calculate the profit made by each student. The cost of each lollipop is $0.5 and the selling price is $0.8, so the profit made by each student is $0.8 - $0.5 = $0.3.
                 Since each student sold 10 lollipops, the total profit made by each student is $0.3 * 10 = $3.
                 Now, let's multiply the profit made by each student by the total number of students. There are 30 students in the class, so the total profit made by the class is $3 * 30 = $90.

To find out how much money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to calculate the amount of money he earned from each sale and add them together.
First, Abraham sold half of his 80 square meters of land for $50. Half of 80 is 40, so he sold 40 square meters of land for $50. The amount of money he earned from this sale is $50.
Next, Abraham sold another 1/4 of his land for $30. 1/4 of 80 is 20, so he sold 20 square meters of land for $30. The amount of money he earned from this sale is $30.
Now, Abraham has 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left. He sold the remaining land for $3 per square meter. The amount of money he earned from this sale is 20 x $3 = $60.
To find the total amount of money Abraham will be able to earn after selling all his unused land, we need to add the amount of money he earned from each sale: $50 + $30 + $60 = $140.
Therefore, Abraham will be able to earn $140 after selling all his unused land.

Since he worked out for 4 hours every week for 6 weeks, we can start by multiplying 4 hours by 6 weeks. This gives us 4 x 6 = 24 hours. Next, we need to add the hours he spent working out in the two weeks when he worked out for 5 hours each. This is 5 x 2 = 10 hours. Finally, we need to add the hours he spent working out in the week when he worked out for 6 hours. This is 6 hours. Now, we can add up all the hours: 24 + 10 + 6 = 40 hours.

To calculate the total cost of the plane for the first year, we need to calculate the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.
                 The cost of the plane itself is $150,000.
                 The cost of renting the hanger is $5000 per month.  Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost of renting the hanger for the first year is $5000 x 12 = $60,000.
                 The cost of fuel is twice the cost of renting the hanger, which is $5000 x 2 = $10,000 per month.  The total cost of fuel for the first year is $10,000 x 12 = $120,000.
                 The total cost of the plane for the first year is the sum of the cost of the plane itself, the cost of renting the hanger, and the cost of fuel.  This is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

To find out how many kilograms of dog food the Kennel house will need in a week, we need to calculate the total amount of dog food consumed by the dogs per day and then multiply it by 7.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed by the German Shepherds per day. There are 3 German Shepherds, and each consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food consumed by the German Shepherds per day is 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms.
                 Next, let's calculate the total amount of dog food consumed by the Bulldogs per day. There are 2 Bulldogs, and each consumes 3 kilograms of dog food per day. So, the total amount of dog food consumed by the Bulldogs per day is 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms.
                 Now, let's add the total amount of dog food consumed by the German Shepherds and the Bulldogs per day. The total amount of dog food consumed per day is 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms.
                 Finally, let's multiply the total amount of dog food consumed per day by 7 to find out how many kilograms of dog food the Kennel house will need in

To find out how much Patty charged for the job, we need to add the cost of the visit, the cost of the labor, and the cost of the parts. The cost of the visit is $40. The cost of the labor is $35 per hour, and the job took 2.25 hours, so the labor cost is $35 x 2.25 = $78.75. The cost of the parts is $60. To find the total cost, we need to add the cost of the visit, the cost of the labor, and the cost of the parts: $40 + $78.75 + $60 = $178.75. Therefore, Patty charged $178.75 for the job.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many white fish Bob bought at the store, we need to set up an equation based on the information given in the problem. Let x be the number of white fish that Bob bought at the store.
                 Initially, Bob had 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. After buying x white fish, he had 3 + x orange fish and 4 + x white fish.
                 The problem states that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. This can be represented by the equation:
                 3 + x = 2(4 + x)
                 To solve for x, we can start by distributing the 2 on the right side of the equation:
                 3 + x = 8 + 2x
                 Next, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation to get:
                 3 = 8 + x
                 Then, we can subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get:
                 -5 = x
                 Therefore, Bob bought -5 white fish at the store. However, since the number of fish cannot be negative, this solution is not valid.

To determine how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we need to calculate 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce. Since the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce, the height it reaches after the first bounce will be 2/3rds of the initial height of 96 feet (3 stories * 24 feet per story).
                 First, calculate 2/3rds of 96 feet: 2/3 * 96 = 64 feet. This is the height the ball reaches after the first bounce.
                 Next, calculate 2/3rds of the height it reached after the first bounce (64 feet): 2/3 * 64 = 42.67 feet. This is the height the ball reaches on its second bounce.

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we first need to determine the number of junior and senior programmers. Since the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and there are 100 employees in total, we can calculate the number of junior programmers as follows:
                 Number of junior programmers = (2/5) * 100
                 Number of junior programmers = 40
                 Since there are 100 employees in total, and 40 are junior programmers, the number of senior programmers is:
                 Number of senior programmers = 100 - 40
                 Number of senior programmers = 60
                 We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. Therefore, the monthly salary of a senior programmer is:
                 Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2000 + $400
                 Monthly salary of a senior programmer = $2400
                 To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we need to calculate the total salary of junior and senior programmers separately and then add them together.

To determine how much force John needs to push the car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car and its contents.  The car itself weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each.  So the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds.  Since the force required to move the car is 1% of its weight, we need to calculate 1% of 1600 pounds.  1% of 1600 pounds is 0.01 x 1600 = 16 pounds.  Therefore, John needs to push the car with a force of 16 pounds.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total number of chocolate bars available. Since there are 8 packets with 5 chocolate bars in each packet, the total number of chocolate bars is 8 * 5 = 40.
                 Next, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the adults will get in total. Since there are 4 adults and each adult gets 6 chocolate bars, the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get is 4 * 6 = 24.
                 To find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children, we subtract the total number of chocolate bars the adults will get from the total number of chocolate bars available. So, 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars are left for the children.
                 Since there are 8 children and the remaining chocolate bars are to be shared equally among them, we divide the remaining chocolate bars by the number of children. So, 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars per child.

To determine how many hours George needs to work before he has enough to pay for the dental work, we first need to calculate the total cost of the dental work. The base price of each implant is $2000. Since George needs 2 implants, the total cost of the implants is 2 x $2000 = $4000. For one of the implants, he wants a crown made of porcelain, which costs an extra $500. Therefore, the total cost of the dental work is $4000 + $500 = $4500. Since George has already put down a deposit of $600, the remaining amount he needs to pay is $4500 - $600 = $3900. To find out how many hours he needs to work, we divide the remaining amount he needs to pay ($3900) by his hourly wage ($15). $3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours.

To find the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we need to multiply the number of portions in one bag by the number of bags and then multiply the result by the weight of each portion.
                 Since there are 8 portions of 2 kilograms each in one bag, the total weight of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.
                 Since there are three bags, the total weight of flour in three bags is 3 * 16 = 48 kilograms.
                 Therefore, there were 48 kilograms of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much change you would get, we need to calculate the total cost of the pencils and erasers first. The total cost of the pencils is 6 x $0.50 = $3.00. The total cost of the erasers is 8 x $0.25 = $2.00. The total cost of the pencils and erasers is $3.00 + $2.00 = $5.00. Since you paid $10, the change you would get is $10 - $5.00 = $5.00. Therefore, you would get $5.00 in change.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to multiply the number of each type of creature by the number of legs it has, and then add those numbers together.
                 First, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has: 80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs.
                 Next, we multiply the number of insects by the number of legs each insect has: 90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs.
                 Then, we multiply the number of rare mutant invertebrates by the number of legs each invertebrate has: 3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs.
                 Finally, we add the number of legs of each type of creature together: 640 legs + 540 legs + 30 legs = 1210 legs.

To calculate the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year.
                 For the first half of the year, Aleena paid $140 per month. Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total amount she paid for the first half of the year is $140 x 6 = $840.
                 For the second half of the year, the streaming company charged Aleena 10% less money. 10% of $140 is $14, so the streaming company charged Aleena $140 - $14 = $126 per month for the second half of the year. Since there are 6 months in the second half of the year, the total amount she paid for the second half of the year is $126 x 6 = $756.
                 The total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is the sum of the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year, which is $840 + $756 = $1596. Therefore, Aleena paid a total

To determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we need to calculate the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater. Since the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel, and it takes Wayne four minutes to get to the theater, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes. Adding this to the 5 minutes Bernadette wants to arrive early, we get 16 + 5 = 21 minutes. Therefore, Bernadette should leave 21 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we need to divide the total number of eggs (900) by the number of eggs each tray can hold (30).
                 900 ÷ 30 = 30
                 Since the farmer can fill 30 trays, and each tray is sold for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray to find the total earnings.
                 30 trays * $2.5 per tray = $75

To determine how many days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to divide the total number of each type of picture scene by the number of scenes she can draw per day, and then add up the number of days it will take to draw each type of scene.
                 First, let's calculate the number of days it will take to draw the large-sized picture scenes: 45 scenes / 5 scenes per day = 9 days.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of days it will take to draw the medium-sized picture scenes: 36 scenes / 6 scenes per day = 6 days.
                 Finally, let's calculate the number of days it will take to draw the small-sized picture scenes: 49 scenes / 7 scenes per day = 7 days.
                 To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to create all of the picture scenes, we need to add up the number of days it will take to draw each type of scene: 9 days + 6 days + 7 days = 22 days.

To determine how many years before the tire needs to be replaced, we first need to calculate how many times the tires will rotate in a month.

Since each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, the tires will last for 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72.3 months.  Since there are 12 months in a year, the tires will last for 72.3 / 12 = 6.025 years.

To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to divide the total capacity of her tank (12 gallons) by the amount of gas she has already used (4 gallons). This will give us the amount of gas left in the tank. We can then multiply the amount of gas left in the tank by the distance she has already traveled (100 miles) to find the total distance she can drive on a single tank of gas.
                 First, we calculate the amount of gas left in the tank: 12 gallons (total capacity) - 4 gallons (gas used) = 8 gallons.
                 Next, we multiply the amount of gas left in the tank by the distance she has already traveled: 8 gallons * 100 miles = 800 miles.
                 Therefore, Sophia can drive 800 miles on a single tank of gas.
                 To find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank, we can multiply the total capacity of the tank (12 gallons) by the distance she can drive on a single tank of gas (800 miles): 12 gallons * 800 miles = 9600 miles.

To find the number of people who accept the position, we first need to determine the number of people who receive a job offer. Since 30% of the applicants receive interviews, and 20% of those who receive interviews receive a job offer, we can calculate the number of people who receive a job offer as follows:
                 30% of 100 = 0.3 x 100 = 30 people receive interviews
                 20% of 30 = 0.2 x 30 = 6 people receive a job offer
                 Since a third of the people who receive a job offer accept the position, we can calculate the number of people who accept the position as follows:
                 1/3 of 6 = 0.33 x 6 = 2 people accept the position.
                 Therefore, 2 people accept the position.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens Patchy has had and add it to the number of kittens Trixie has had. Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens, which means Patchy has had 3 * 7 = 21 kittens. Trixie has had 12 kittens. Therefore, the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is 21 (Patchy's kittens) + 12 (Trixie's kittens) = 33 kittens. The Doubtfire family now has a total of 33 kittens.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many movies Colby can see, we need to calculate how much money he has left after buying popcorn and candy. He has $150. Popcorn costs $8 and candy costs $2. So, the total cost of popcorn and candy is $8 + $2 = $10. He has $150 - $10 = $140 left. Since tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10, he can see $140 / $10 = 14 movies on Fridays and Saturdays. Since he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, he can see 14 - 5 = 9 more movies on Fridays and Saturdays. Since tickets for other days cost $7, he can see $140 / $7 = 20 movies on other days. Since he already saw 8 movies on other days, he can see 20 - 8 = 12 more movies on other days. In total, Colby can see 9 + 12 = 21 movies. The answer is 21.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we need to first calculate the total number of tins of cat food and the total number of tins of dog food. We can do this by multiplying the number of packages of cat food by the number of tins in each package, and multiplying the number of packages of dog food by the number of tins in each package. Then, we subtract the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food.
                 The total number of tins of cat food is 8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins. The total number of tins of dog food is 6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins.
                 Subtracting the total number of tins of dog food from the total number of tins of cat food, we get 88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins. Therefore, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of jellyfish in the tank, let's break down the information given. We know that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. We also know that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.
                 Since a third of the large jellyfish change color, and 6 jellyfish changed color, we can set up the equation 1/3 * L = 6, where L is the number of large jellyfish. Solving for L, we get L = 6 * 3 = 18. This means there are 18 large jellyfish in the tank.
                 Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can set up the equation 1/5 * T = 18, where T is the total number of jellyfish. Solving for T, we get T = 18 * 5 = 90. This means there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

## Step 1: Calculate the number of boys
Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2. boys = 2 * girls = 2 * 60 = 120.
## Step 2: Calculate the total number of students
To find the total number of students, we need to add the number of boys and girls. total_students = boys + girls = 120 + 60 = 180.
## Step 3: Calculate the number of teachers
Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can calculate the number of teachers by dividing the total number of students by 5. teachers = total_students / 5 = 180 / 5 = 36.
The final answer is: $\boxed{36}$<|eot_id|>

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to calculate the cost of each feature and add it to the base price of the truck. The base price of the truck is $30,000. The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500, so the total cost so far is $30,000 + $7,500 = $37,500. The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, which is $7,500, so the cost of the leather seats is $7,500 / 3 = $2,500. The total cost so far is $37,500 + $2,500 = $40,000. The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so the cost of the running boards is $2,500 - $500 = $2,000. The total cost so far is $40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000. The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500, so the total cost of the truck is $42,000 + $1,500 = $43,500. Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of people in South America, we need to multiply the number of countries by the number of cities in each country, and then multiply the result by the population of each city.
                 First, we multiply the number of countries (26) by the number of cities in each country (5):
                 26 x 5 = 130
                 Then, we multiply the result (130) by the population of each city (1000):

To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to find out how many goals each of them scored. We know that Richie scored 80 goals. We also know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. Additionally, we know that Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. To find the total number of goals scored by all three teenagers, we need to add the number of goals scored by each of them: 80 (Richie) + 60 (Mark) + 35 (Anna) = 175 goals.

To find out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year, we need to calculate the total amount of water he uses in a year and then multiply it by the cost per gallon. Since Gary does laundry twice a week, there are 52 weeks in a year, so he does laundry 52 x 2 = 104 times in a year. Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water, so the total amount of water he uses in a year is 104 x 20 = 2080 gallons. Since a gallon of water costs $0.15, the total amount Gary spends on water for laundry in a year is 2080 x $0.15 = $312.00. Therefore, Gary spends $312.00 on water for laundry in a year.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many hours it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete the 360 piece puzzle, we need to calculate how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle and then convert that to hours.
                 Since Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda, her mom can add 2 pieces per minute.
                 Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.
                 To find out how many minutes it will take them to complete the puzzle, we need to divide the total number of pieces (360) by the number of pieces they can add per minute (6).
                 360 ÷ 6 = 60 minutes
                 Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 60 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
                 60 ÷ 60 = 1 hour

To determine the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the number of each type of laundry item and then add them together.

                 The cost of the pizza is $15. To find 1/5 of the cost of the pizza, we multiply $15 by 1/5, which is the same as multiplying $15 by 0.2.

To determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly could stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the maximum distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone.  We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet.  With the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than without the gemstone.  Therefore, the maximum distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone is 3 x 400 = 1200 feet.  Since the dragon's flames can reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.

To find out how much Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to calculate the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the cost of her visits for the next 3 years.
                 For the first 5 years, the cost of one visit was $2. Since Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, she spent $2 * 3 = $6 per year. For 5 years, she spent $6 * 5 = $30.
                 For the next 3 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%. This means that the new cost of one visit is $2 + ($2 * 1.5) = $3. Since Pauline visited the museum 3 times a year, she spent $3 * 3 = $9 per year. For 3 years, she spent $9 * 3 = $27.
                 To find the total amount Pauline spent on all visits to the museum, we need to add the cost of her visits for the first 5 years and the cost of her visits for the next 3 years. $30 + $27 = $57.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. This means he can make 60 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour. Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. This means Marissa can make 3/4 * 60 = 45 pounds of chocolates in 1 hour. If they worked for 12 hours in a day, Ruiz would make 60 * 12 = 720 pounds of chocolates. Marissa would make 45 * 12 = 540 pounds of chocolates. Together, they would make 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates. The answer is 1260.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pizzas are left, we need to calculate the number of pizzas eaten by the glee club and the football team, and then subtract that from the total number of pizzas ordered.
                 The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them. 70% of 20 is 0.7 x 20 = 14. So, the glee club ate 14 pizzas.
                 The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which is 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas. The football team ate 80% of them. 80% of 40 is 0.8 x 40 = 32. So, the football team ate 32 pizzas.
                 The total number of pizzas eaten is 14 (glee club) + 32 (football team) = 46 pizzas.
                 The total number of pizzas ordered is 20 (glee club) + 40 (football team) = 60 pizzas.
                 To find out how many pizzas are left, we subtract the total number of pizzas eaten from the total number of pizzas ordered: 60 - 46 = 14.
                 Therefore, there are 14 pizzas left.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure, we first need to determine the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day. The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day, 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes on the third day, but 2 of those holes were filled in. So, the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day is 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes. Since the island had four times as many holes by the end of the fourth day as it did at the end of the first day, the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day is 4 * 10 = 40 holes. To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we subtract the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day from the total number of holes dug by the end of the fourth day: 40 - 29 = 11 holes. Therefore, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of students Miss Maria has, we first need to calculate the total number of cards she has. She has six decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so the total number of basketball cards is 6 x 25 = 150. She also has five boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so the total number of baseball cards is 5 x 40 = 200. Therefore, the total number of cards she has is 150 + 200 = 350. Since she keeps 50 cards for herself, the number of cards she gives to her students is 350 - 50 = 300. If each student gets ten cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 / 10 = 30. The answer is 30.<|eot_id|>

Let x be the number of cupcakes Carly made. Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies she made is 3x - 2. The total number of treats is the sum of the number of cupcakes and the number of brownies, which is x + 3x - 2 = 4x - 2. Since there are five people in the class and each person gets two treats, the total number of treats is 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, we can set up the equation 4x - 2 = 10 and solve for x. Adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get 4x = 12. Dividing both sides of the equation by 4, we get x = 3. Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many oranges everyone will get, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people, including Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends.
                 First, we need to find the total number of oranges. Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, the total number of oranges is 34 + 22 = 56.
                 Next, we need to find the total number of people. Sitti and Juris have 6 friends each, so the total number of friends is 6 + 6 = 12. Including Sitti and Juris, the total number of people is 12 + 2 = 14.
                 Now, we can divide the total number of oranges (56) by the total number of people (14) to find out how many oranges everyone will get. 56 ÷ 14 = 4.

To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.
First, we know that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Since each pepper costs 15$, a watermelon costs 3 * 15$ = 45$.
Next, we know that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon costs. So, an orange costs 45$ - 5$ = 40$.
Now that we know the cost of each item, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend.
The cost of 4 watermelons is 4 * 45$ = 180$.
The cost of 20 peppers is 20 * 15$ = 300$.
The cost of 10 oranges is 10 * 40$ = 400$.
To find the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we add the cost of each item together: 180$ + 300$ + 400$ = 880$.
Therefore, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is 880$.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of trucks needed to transport 80 flagstones, we need to calculate the total weight of the flagstones first. Since each flagstone weighs 75 pounds, the total weight of 80 flagstones is 80 x 75 = 6000 pounds.
                 Since the delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight of the flagstones (6000 pounds) by the weight capacity of each truck (2000 pounds).
                 6000 ÷ 2000 = 3

Since Marie paid a total of $50, the cost of the pizza must be $50 - $33 = $17. Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide $17 by $8.50 to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered. $17 ÷ $8.50 = 2. This means that Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

To determine the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read by the end, we need to add up the number of books each of them has and the number of books they will read from each other.
                 Dolly has 2 books.
                 Pandora has 1 book.
                 Dolly will read Pandora's 1 book and her own 2 books, for a total of 1 + 2 = 3 books.
                 Pandora will read Dolly's 2 books and her own 1 book, for a total of 2 + 1 = 3 books.
                 The total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read by the end is 3 (Dolly's books) + 3 (Pandora's books) = 6 books.
                 Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 6 books by the end.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many calories John consumed, we need to first find out how many ounces of milk he drank.  Since he drank 2 glasses of milk, and each glass is 8 ounces, he drank 2 x 8 = 16 ounces of milk.  Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, he consumed 16 x 3 = 48 calories.  Therefore, John consumed 48 calories.  The answer is 48.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we first need to calculate the number of microphones that won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in, we need to calculate 20% of 50, which is 0.2 x 50 = 10. This means that 10 microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs. To find the number of pairs of microphones that the singer was able to arrange on the stage, we subtract the number of microphones that won't find any space to fit in from the total number of microphones, which is 50 - 10 = 40. Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 40 / 2 = 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.<|eot_id|>

Let x be the number of apples Joanne gathers from the average trees. Since Joanne gathers half as many apples from the shortest trees as from the tallest trees, she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees, so she gathers 2 * 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees. Since her sister gathers 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, she gathers 3 * 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees. The total number of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees is 30 + 60 + 15 + 45 = 150. Since the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, Joanne must have gathered 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees. Therefore, Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we need to work backwards. We know that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms of meat. Since the Allosaurus ate half of what was left after the T-Rex ate, we need to multiply 270 by 2 to find out how much meat was left after the T-Rex ate. 270 * 2 = 540 kilograms of meat were left after the T-Rex ate. Since the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, we need to multiply 540 by 2 to find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. 540 * 2 = 1080 kilograms of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.

To find out how many days it will take for the child to save the remaining amount of money, we need to first calculate the remaining amount he needs to save. The toy car costs $12 and he already has $4, so the remaining amount he needs to save is $12 - $4 = $8.
                 Since he promises to save $2 daily from his allowance, we can divide the remaining amount he needs to save ($8) by the daily savings amount ($2) to find out how many days it will take him to save the remaining amount.
                 $8 ÷ $2 = 4 days

To find out how much you have to pay for the laptop after a 20% discount, you need to calculate 20% of the original price and subtract that amount from the original price.
                 The original price of the laptop is $1000. 20% of $1000 is 0.20 x $1000 = $200.
                 Subtracting $200 from the original price of $1000, you get $1000 - $200 = $800.
                 Therefore, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.
                 Alternatively, you can calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage (20% = 0.20) and then subtracting that amount from the original price.
                 $1000 x 0.20 = $200.
                 $1000 - $200 = $800.
                 Therefore, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.
                 In both cases, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.
                 Therefore, you have to pay $800 for the laptop after the 20% discount.
                 Therefore, you have to pay $800

To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total amount of feed she has given her chickens so far.  In the morning, she gave her chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gave her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  So, the total amount of feed she has given her chickens so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.  Since each chicken needs three cups of feed per day, we need to divide the total amount of feed she has given her chickens so far by 3 to determine how many cups of feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day.  40 cups of feed / 3 cups of feed per chicken = 13.33 cups of feed.  Since Wendi can't give her chickens a fraction of a cup of feed, she will need to give her chickens 14 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.  Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 14 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Gerald has left, we need to first calculate how much he earned in a week. Since he earns $30 every day and there are 7 days in a week, we multiply $30 by 7. $30 x 7 = $210. Since Gerald spent a total of $100, we need to subtract $100 from $210 to find out how much he has left. $210 - $100 = $110. Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.
First, we need to find out how much each boy initially received. Since $18 is shared among 3 boys, each boy gets $18 / 3 = $6.
The eldest boy added $5 to his share, making it $6 + $5 = $11. The next day, he added another $10, bringing his total to $11 + $10 = $21.
Then, he spent $8 from his total, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.
After saving some more, he tripled the amount he had left after spending the $8. So, we need to multiply $13 by 3 to find out how much he has now: $13 * 3 = $39.
Therefore, the eldest boy now has $39.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we need to calculate the number of games he buys each year and add the 5 games he gets for Christmas each year.
                 In the first year, Steve buys 1 game per month for 12 months, so he buys 1 x 12 = 12 games.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 12 + 5 = 17 games.
                 In the second year, Steve buys 2 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 2 x 12 = 24 games.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 24 + 5 = 29 games.
                 In the third year, Steve buys 4 games per month for 12 months, so he buys 4 x 12 = 48 games.  He also gets 5 games for Christmas, so he has 48 + 5 = 53 games.
                 To find the total number of games Steve has after 3 years, we add the number of games he has at the end of each year: 17 + 29 + 53 = 99 games.
                 Therefore, Steve has 99 games after 3 years

To determine the cost of each single bagel after the discount, first calculate the total cost of the 4 packs of bagels before the discount.  The total cost is 4 packs * $10.00 per pack = $40.00.  With a 10% discount, the discount amount is $40.00 * 0.10 = $4.00.  Therefore, the total cost after the discount is $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.  Since there are 9 bagels in each pack, the total number of bagels is 4 packs * 9 bagels per pack = 36 bagels.  To find the cost of each single bagel, divide the total cost after the discount by the total number of bagels: $36.00 ÷ 36 bagels = $1.00 per bagel.  Therefore, each single bagel will cost $1.00 after the discount.<|eot_id|>

Since each large bag weighs 10 ounces and there are 30 M&M in each ounce, the total number of M&M in each large bag is 10 * 30 = 300.  Since there are 3 large bags, the total number of M&M is 300 * 3 = 900.  Since John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, the total number of small bags he can make is 900 / 10 = 90.

To determine the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, we need to calculate the number of shoes sold each day and then add them together.
                 On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
                 The next day, they sold double that number, so they sold 2 x 14 = 28 pairs of tennis shoes.
                 On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before, so they sold 28 / 2 = 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
                 However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we need to subtract 6 from the total number of shoes sold.

To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to first determine the ratio of the adult's slice to the kid's slice. Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the ratio of the adult's slice to the kid's slice is 2:1.
                 Next, we need to determine the total number of slices. Since there are 2 adults and 4 kids, the total number of slices is 2 + 4 = 6 slices.
                 Since the ratio of the adult's slice to the kid's slice is 2:1, the adult's slice is 2/3 of the total number of slices. Therefore, each adult gets 2/3 * 6 = 4 slices.
                 To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we need to divide the number of slices each adult gets by the total number of slices and multiply by 100. Therefore, each adult gets (4/6) * 100 = 66.67% of the watermelon.

To find out how many pounds of hay Nate needs, we first need to determine how much hay each sheep needs. Since each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice the amount each goat needs, and each goat needs 5 pounds, each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.

Jonathan starts with 2 dozen measuring cups, which is equivalent to 2 x 12 = 24 measuring cups. Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, he has 2/3 x 24 = 16 measuring spoons. After gifting Pedro 6 measuring spoons, Jonathan has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons. Therefore, Jonathan has a total of 24 measuring cups + 10 measuring spoons = 34 utensils remaining. The answer is 34.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we first need to calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School. Since Butler High School enrolls an average of 3/4 as many students as Norman High School, we can calculate the average enrollment at Butler High School by multiplying the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4.
                 3/4 * 4000 = 3000
                 Therefore, the average enrollment at Butler High School is 3000 students. To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School.
                 4000 - 3000 = 1000
                 Therefore, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of good days left in the month, we need to calculate the total number of days that have been recorded so far. Christina's first eight days were good, her second eight days were bad, and her third eight days were neutral. Therefore, the total number of days that have been recorded so far is 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 days.
                 Christina's next three days were good, neutral, and good. Therefore, the total number of days that have been recorded so far is 24 + 3 = 27 days.
                 Since Christina records her mood every day, the total number of days in the month is 30. Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 30 - 27 = 3 days.
                 So, there are 3 good days left in the month.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Mulan has left, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she bought and subtract it from the total amount of money she had.
                 First, let's calculate the total cost of the jeans. She bought two pairs at $30 each, so the total cost of the jeans is 2 x $30 = $60.
                 Next, let's add the cost of the bag, which is $20. The total cost of the items she bought is $60 + $20 = $80.
                 Now, let's subtract the total cost of the items she bought from the total amount of money she had. She had $40 initially and spent $80, so she has $40 - $80 = -$40.
                 Since Mulan can't have a negative amount of money, this means that she spent more money than she had. Therefore, Mulan doesn't have any money left. She is $40 short.
                 So, the answer is that Mulan doesn't have any money left. She is $40 short.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of chairs that Candy will be able to rent out in two 4-week months, we need to calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays and weekends separately, and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekdays. There are 5 weekdays in a week, and each weekday, 60 chairs are rented. So, the total number of chairs rented during the weekdays in a week is 5 x 60 = 300.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during the weekends. There are 2 weekend days in a week, and each weekend day, 100 chairs are rented. So, the total number of chairs rented during the weekends in a week is 2 x 100 = 200.
                 Now, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in a week. This is the sum of the chairs rented during the weekdays and weekends, which is 300 + 200 = 500.
                 Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the total number of chairs rented in a month is 4 x 500 = 2000.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many cookies Max, Summer, and the Cookie Monster have. Since Katarina has 68 cookies and she has 5 less cookies than Max, Max must have 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, the Cookie Monster must have 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. Finally, since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, Summer must have 73 + 23 = 96 cookies. To find the total number of cookies, we add the number of cookies each person has: 68 + 73 + 96 + 61 = 298. Therefore, they have a total of 298 cookies.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the share of the first person, let's denote the amount the first person took as x. The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the second person took x + 80. The third person took twice what the second person took, so the third person took 2(x + 80). The total amount taken by all three people is x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80), which is equal to $1920. This can be written as an equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920. Solving for x, we get x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920. Combining like terms, we get 4x + 240 = 1920. Subtracting 240 from both sides, we get 4x = 1680. Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = 420. Therefore, the share of the first person is $420.<|eot_id|>

To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages. Since Harriet is 21 years old now, and she is half the age of Zack, we can calculate Zack's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 2. Therefore, Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old. Next, since Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, we can calculate Adrian's age by multiplying Harriet's age by 3. Therefore, Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old. In three years, Harriet's age will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old, Zack's age will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old, and Adrian's age will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.

To find the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit, and then divide the result by the weight of a single box.
                 First, subtract the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.
                 Next, divide the result by the weight of a single box: 1245 / 15 = 83.
                 Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many of the animals are chickens, we need to know how many legs chickens and cows have. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. If we let x be the number of chickens and y be the number of cows, we can set up the following equation: 2x + 4y = 70. We know that x + y = 20, since there are 20 animals in total. We can solve this system of equations to find the value of x, which represents the number of chickens. First, we can multiply the equation x + y = 20 by 2 to get 2x + 2y = 40. Then, we can subtract 2x + 2y = 40 from 2x + 4y = 70 to get 2y = 30. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 15. Now that we know y, we can substitute y = 15 into the equation x + y = 20 to get x + 15 = 20. Subtracting 15 from both sides, we get x = 5. Therefore, there are 5 chickens on Farmer Brown's farm.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much candy each of them would have, we need to add up the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have, and then divide it by 3 (the number of people).
                 First, let's add up the total amount of candy:
                 3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds
                 Now, let's divide the total amount of candy by 3:
                 12 pounds ÷ 3 = 4 pounds

To find the total number of quarts of ice cream made in 48 hours, we need to calculate the number of quarts of chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours.  Since the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, we can divide 48 hours by 2 hours to find out how many 2-hour periods are in 48 hours. 48 ÷ 2 = 24.  Since the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in each 2-hour period, we can multiply 24 by 100 to find the total number of quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours. 24 × 100 = 2400.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of quarts of vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours.  Since the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, we can divide 48 hours by 4 hours to find out how many 4-hour periods are in 48 hours. 48 ÷ 4 = 12.  Since the factory makes

To find the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the amount of money he will make from his standard lessons and the amount of money he will make from his lessons with a veteran, and then add the two amounts together.
First, let's calculate the amount of money Charlie will make from his standard lessons.  He has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.  So, the total amount of money he will make from his standard lessons is 4 x $80 = $320.
Next, let's calculate the amount of money Charlie will make from his lessons with a veteran.  He has 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran at a reduced rate of 25% off his standard rate of $80 per hour.  The reduced rate is $80 - (25% of $80) = $80 - $20 = $60 per hour.  So, the total amount of money he will make from his lessons with a veteran is 2 x $60 = $120.
Finally, let's add the amount of money Charlie will make from his standard lessons and the amount of money he will make from his lessons with a veteran to find the total amount of money he will make

In 8 years, Jame will be 27 + 8 = 35 years old.  In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age, so his cousin will be 2 * 35 - 5 = 70 - 5 = 65 years old.  The age difference between Jame and his cousin in 8 years will be 65 - 35 = 30 years.  Therefore, the age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 30 - 8 = 22 years.  Jame is currently 27 years old, so his cousin is 27 + 22 = 49 years old.  The age difference between Jame and his cousin now is 49 - 27 = 22 years.  The answer is 22.<|eot_id|>

To find the total cost of Helen's trip, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the cost of the hotel. Helen booked the hotel for 3 nights, and one night costs $80. So, the total cost of the hotel is 3 x $80 = $240.
Next, let's calculate the cost of the bus trips. Helen rode the bus 7 times, and each bus trip costs 10% of the price of one night at the hotel. 10% of $80 is $8. So, the total cost of the bus trips is 7 x $8 = $56.
Now, let's add the cost of the hotel and the cost of the bus trips together to find the total cost of Helen's trip. The total cost is $240 + $56 = $296.

To determine how much money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, we first need to determine how many sandwiches he needs to make.  Since each sandwich serves 4 people and there will be 20 people watching the game, we divide 20 by 4 to get 5.  Therefore, Tyson needs to make 5 sandwiches.  Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, he will need 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.  The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound.  Therefore, the total cost of the meat will be 5 x $7.00 = $35.00.  The total cost of the cheese will be 5 x $3.00 = $15.00.  The total cost of the meat and cheese will be $35.00 + $15.00 = $50.00.

To determine the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of shirts for each size and then add them together.
First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small shirts. Since twice as many students need size small as extra small, we multiply 11 by 2 to get 22 students who need size small shirts.
Next, we know that four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, we subtract 4 from 22 to get 18 students who need size medium shirts.
Then, we know that half as many students need size large as size medium. So, we divide 18 by 2 to get 9 students who need size large shirts.
After that, we know that six more students need size extra-large than large. So, we add 6 to 9 to get 15 students who need size extra-large shirts.
Finally, we add up the number of shirts for each size: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75.
Therefore, Krissa ordered a total of 75 shirts for her preschool students.<|eot_id|>

                 First, let's calculate the amount of money Jason earned from emptying the dishwasher.  He emptied the dishwasher 6 times, and each time he earned $0.50.  So, the total amount of money he earned from emptying the dishwasher is 6 x $0.50 = $3.00.
                 Next, let's calculate the amount of money Jason earned from doing his laundry.  He did his laundry once, and each time he earned $3.00.  So, the total amount of money he earned from doing his laundry is 1 x $3.00 = $3.00.
                 Then, let's calculate the amount of money Jason earned from taking the trash to the curb.  He took the trash out twice, and each time he earned $0.75.  So, the total amount of money he earned from taking the trash to the curb is 2 x $0.75 = $1.50.
                 Finally, let's calculate the amount of money Jason earned from cleaning his room.  He cleaned his room once, and each time he earned

To determine how many telephone calls Jason needs to make to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus, we need to break down the process step by step.  First, we know that for every 25 telephone calls he makes, Jason gets one person to come into the car dealership to look at new cars.  This means that to get 15 customers, he needs to make 15 x 25 = 375 telephone calls.  Next, we know that for every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  This means that to get 15 customers, he needs to have 15 x 2 = 30 people come into the car dealership.  Since he gets one customer for every 25 telephone calls, he needs to make 30 x 25 = 750 telephone calls to get 30 customers.  Therefore, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much it will cost Dennis to purchase 6 pounds of butter, we first need to find out how many pounds of butter he will need to make 6 dozen croissants.  Since he uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, he will need 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants.  Since the butter costs $4.00 a pound, 6 pounds of butter will cost him 6 x $4.00 = $24.00.  However, the grocery store has a promotion for buy one pound of butter get one half off.  This means that for every two pounds of butter he buys, he will only pay for 1.5 pounds of butter.  Since he needs 6 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 6 pounds of butter in two separate transactions.  In the first transaction, he will buy 3 pounds of butter for $4.00 x 3 = $12.00.  In the second transaction, he will buy 3 pounds of butter for $4.00 x 3 = $12.00, but he will only pay for 1.5 pounds of butter, so he will pay $4.00 x

To determine how many loads of laundry Greg does in a year, we need to calculate how many loads he does in a week and then multiply that number by 52.
                 First, we need to calculate how many loads he does in a week.  He puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week.  His laundry machine will only allow him to wash 2 twin sets of sheets at a time and 1 king set of sheets at a time.  So, he does 2 loads of twin sheets per week and 1 load of king sheets per week.  In total, he does 2 + 1 = 3 loads of laundry per week.
                 Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the number of loads per week by 52.  3 loads/week * 52 weeks/year = 156 loads/year.
                 Therefore, Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of fruits that Morisette and Kael have, we need to calculate the number of fruits each of them brought and then add them together.
                 Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so the total number of fruits she brought is 5 + 8 = 13.
                 Kael brought twice the amount of apples than Morisette, which is 2 x 5 = 10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, which is 8 / 2 = 4 oranges. So, the total number of fruits Kael brought is 10 + 4 = 14.
                 To find the total number of fruits they have, we add the number of fruits each of them brought: 13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits) = 27.

To calculate the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages, we first need to determine the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages. Since the dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes, and the cat takes 30 minutes, the dog will take 2/3 * 30 = 20 minutes to eat the sausages.
                 Now that we know the time it takes the dog to eat the sausages, we can calculate the average time by adding the time it takes the cat and the dog to eat the sausages and dividing by 2. The cat takes 30 minutes, and the dog takes 20 minutes, so the average time is (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.
                 Therefore, the average time the cat and dog take to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces, we first need to calculate the total number of toys produced by the first 5 workers during their 10-hour shift. The first 2 workers produce 6 toys an hour, so in 10 hours they produce 2 x 6 x 10 = 120 toys. The other 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour, so in 10 hours they produce 2 x 4 x 10 = 80 toys. Therefore, the total number of toys produced by the first 5 workers is 120 + 80 = 200 toys. Since the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, the first 5 workers must have produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys. Since the first 5 workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 - 200 = 180 toys. Since the fifth worker worked for 10 hours, the fifth worker must produce 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour. Therefore, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.<|eot_id|>

To determine the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day, we need to calculate the total number of birds attracted to each type of bird feeder and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought bird feeders. Since there are 3 store-bought bird feeders and each attracts 20 birds, the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders is 3 x 20 = 60 birds.
Next, let's calculate the total number of birds attracted to the bird feeders Lillian made herself. Since there are 3 bird feeders made by Lillian and each attracts 20 + 10 = 30 birds, the total number of birds attracted to the homemade feeders is 3 x 30 = 90 birds.
Now, let's add the total number of birds attracted to the store-bought feeders and the homemade feeders to get the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day. The total number of birds is 60 + 90 = 150 birds.
Therefore, Lillian can expect to see 150 birds in her garden each day if the same amount keep coming to her bird feeders

To determine the number of red roses that must be delivered by 5 pm, we need to find out how many white carnations Sandra ordered. We know that the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, and the number of pink calla lilies is five times the number of white carnations. Since Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, we can set up the equation 5x = 200, where x is the number of white carnations. Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40. This means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations. Since the number of red roses is four times the number of white carnations, the number of red roses is 4 * 40 = 160. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.<|eot_id|>

To determine the cost of painting the room, we need to calculate the total surface area of the four walls. The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 10 x 8 = 80 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 80 = 160 square feet. The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet, so each of these walls has an area of 5 x 8 = 40 square feet. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 x 40 = 80 square feet. The total surface area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost will be 12 x $12 = $144. Therefore, it will cost $144 to paint the room.<|eot_id|>

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, we can represent Seth's age as 2x and Brooke's age as x. In 2 years, Seth's age will be 2x + 2 and Brooke's age will be x + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 4 = 28. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3x = 24. Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 8. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age is 2x = 2(8) = 16. Therefore, Seth is 16 years old.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of pink candies in the bag, we first need to calculate the number of orange and yellow candies. Since there are twice as many orange candies as red candies, and there are 54 red candies, the number of orange candies is 54 * 2 = 108. Since there are half as many yellow candies as red candies, the number of yellow candies is 54 / 2 = 27. The total number of red, orange, and yellow candies is 54 + 108 + 27 = 189. To find the number of pink candies, we subtract the total number of red, orange, and yellow candies from the total number of candies in the bag, which is 232. Therefore, the number of pink candies is 232 - 189 = 43. The final answer is 43.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much farther the winner runs than the loser, we need to calculate the total distance run by each of them.
Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard football field. Since he is running back and forth, he is covering the entire length of the field twice. So, the total distance run by Blake is 2 x 100 yards = 200 yards.
Kelly runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. Since she is running to the 40-yard line and back, she is covering a distance of 40 yards + 40 yards = 80 yards twice. So, the total distance run by Kelly is 2 x 80 yards = 160 yards.
Since Blake runs 200 yards and Kelly runs 160 yards, Blake runs 200 - 160 = 40 yards farther than Kelly.
Therefore, the winner runs 40 yards farther than the loser.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of seashells brought back by the groups, we first need to find out how many groups were formed. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we can divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups. 90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups. Since 3/5 of the number of groups had members bring back seashells, we can multiply the number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought back seashells. 10 × 3/5 = 6 groups. Since each group had 9 members, we can multiply the number of groups that brought back seashells by 9 to find the total number of members who brought back seashells. 6 × 9 = 54 members. Since each member brought back 2 seashells, we can multiply the number of members who brought back seashells by 2 to find the total number of seashells brought back. 54 × 2 = 108 seashells. Therefore, the groups brought back a total of 108 seashells.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of checks Buford writes per year, we need to calculate the total number of checks he writes in a month and then multiply that number by 12.
                 First, let's calculate the number of checks Buford writes per month.  He writes 1 check for the electric bill and 1 check for the gas bill, for a total of 2 checks per month.  He also writes 2 checks per month to the church.  So, in total, he writes 2 + 2 = 4 checks per month.
                 Next, we need to calculate the number of checks Buford writes per year.  Since he writes 4 checks per month, and there are 12 months in a year, he writes 4 x 12 = 48 checks per year.

To find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we need to first find out how many steps he took in total. We know that he finished half of his steps on his walks to and from school and did another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. Half of 10,000 steps is 10,000 / 2 = 5,000 steps. So, he took 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps on his walks to and from school and going for a short walk with his friend. We also know that after he had finished his jog, he only had 2,000 steps left to take. This means that he took 10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 steps in total. Since he took 6,000 steps on his walks to and from school and going for a short walk with his friend, he must have taken 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.

To determine the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, we need to calculate the number of lines in each scene and the song, and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the number of lines in the song. The song has 54 lines.
Next, we'll calculate the number of lines in the first scene. The first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, so it has 2 * 54 = 108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 108 / 3 = 36 lines from the first scene.
Then, we'll calculate the number of lines in the second scene. The second scene has six more lines than the song, so it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * (4/5) = 48 lines from the second scene.
Finally, we'll add up the total number of lines Sean has to memorize: 54 (song) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines.
Therefore, Sean has to memorize a total of 138 lines.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons after the price increase, we first need to find out the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase. We know that the cost of filling 20 balloons was $900, so the cost of filling one balloon was $900 / 20 = $45. After the price increase, the cost of filling one balloon was $45 + $20 = $65. To find out how much Bentley paid to fill 170 balloons, we need to multiply the cost of filling one balloon after the price increase by 170. $65 * 170 = $11,050. Therefore, Bentley paid $11,050 to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we need to first determine the amount of water passing through the river on the second day. Since the amount of water passing through the river doubles on the second day, we multiply the initial amount of 4000 gallons by 2. This gives us 8000 gallons of water passing through the river on the second day.
Next, we are given that the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons on the third day. To find the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day, we add 6000 gallons to the amount of water passing through the river on the second day. This gives us 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons of water passing through the river on the third day.
Finally, to find the total amount of water passing through the river at that point, we add the amount of water passing through the river on the third day to the amount of water passing through the river on the second day. This gives us 14000 + 8000 = 22000 gallons of water passing through the river at that point.
Therefore, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is

To find the cost of the boots, we first need to determine the cost of the two pairs of heels. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other costs twice as much, which is $33 x 2 = $66. The total cost of the two pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99. Since the two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots, the boots must cost $99 + $5 = $104. Therefore, the boots cost $104.<|eot_id|>

To find the average weight of the 3 friends, we need to first find their individual weights.  Mark weighs 150 pounds.  Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.  Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.  The total weight of the 3 friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.  To find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of friends, which is 540 / 3 = 180 pounds.  Therefore, the average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds.<|eot_id|>

To find the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to calculate the distance traveled in each segment of the trip and then add them together.
First, Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. So, the total distance traveled in the first 4 days is 200 * 4 = 800 kilometers.
Next, over the next two days, he traveled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days. 30% of 800 kilometers is 0.3 * 800 = 240 kilometers. So, the total distance traveled over the next two days is 240 kilometers.
Then, on the next day, he wasn't traveling at all, so the distance traveled on that day is 0 kilometers.
Now, let's calculate the distance traveled during the second week. Tom made 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. So, the total distance traveled during the second week is 300 * 7 = 2100 kilometers.
To find the total distance traveled by Tom during his two-week-long trip, we need to add the distance traveled in each segment of the trip: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.
Therefore, Tom

To calculate the amount of money Antonella earned if she sold goods worth $2500, we need to break down her commission into two parts: the base commission for selling goods worth $1000 and the additional commission for sales over $1000.
                 First, let's calculate the base commission for selling goods worth $1000. The base commission is 30% of $1000, which is 0.3 x $1000 = $300.
                 Next, let's calculate the additional commission for sales over $1000. The additional commission is 10% of $1500 ($2500 - $1000), which is 0.1 x $1500 = $150.
                 Finally, let's add the base commission and the additional commission to find the total amount of money Antonella earned. The total commission is $300 + $150 = $450.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.
To find the total age of the four birds, we need to add the ages of Sally Four, Granny Red, Sally Two, and Sally Thirty-two. The total age is 8 + 16 + 19 + 8 = 51 years.

To find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories she has chosen. We can do this by adding up the cost of the machine, the scanner, the CD burner, and the printer.
                Total cost = cost of machine + cost of scanner + cost of CD burner + cost of printer
                Total cost = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

To find out how much profit Millie will make per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand, we first need to find out how many cups of lemonade she can make with the money she spent. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade and she spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade. Since she sells each cup of lemonade for $1, she will make 36 x $1 = $36 from selling all of the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour that her lemonade stand is open, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all of the lemonade. Since she will make $36 from selling all of the lemonade and it will take her 9 hours to sell all of the lemonade, she will make $36 / 9 = $4 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

To find the total cost of their rentals, we need to calculate the cost of Carlos' canoe rental and Benji's banana boat raft rental separately, and then add them together.
Carlos' canoe rental costs $30 an hour, and he uses the canoe for 3 hours. So, his total cost is:
$30/hour x 3 hours = $90
Benji's banana boat raft rental costs $18 an hour, and he uses the raft for 5 hours. So, his total cost is:
$18/hour x 5 hours = $90
Now, we need to add their costs together to find the total cost of their rentals:
$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180
Therefore, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of boys in the third class, we first need to determine the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students in the school is 20 * 3 = 60 students.
Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the number of boys in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 boys.
We know that the first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls. So, the total number of girls in the first two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.
To find the number of girls in the third class, we subtract the total number of girls in the first two classes from the total number of girls in the school. Since the school is 50% girls, the total number of girls in the school is 50% of 60, which is 0.5 * 60 = 30 girls. Therefore, the number of girls in the third class is 30 - 27 = 3 girls.

To determine how much money Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for one week and then multiply it by 52 weeks.
                 The cost of the pasta is $1.00 per box, and Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, so he spends $1.00 per week on pasta.
                 The cost of the cheddar cheese is $3.00, and the cost of the gruyere cheese is twice that amount, which is $6.00.  So, the total cost of the cheese is $3.00 + $6.00 = $9.00 per week.
                 The total cost of the ingredients for one week is $1.00 (pasta) + $9.00 (cheese) = $10.00 per week.
                 Since Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week, the total cost of the ingredients for one year is $10.00 per week x 52 weeks per year = $520.00 per year.
                 Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 per year on making macaroni and cheese.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total salary Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago.
Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can calculate Lylah's salary by dividing Adrien's salary by 1.3.
Lylah's salary four years ago = Adrien's salary four years ago / 1.3
Lylah's salary four years ago = $40000 / 1.3
Lylah's salary four years ago = $30769.23
Step 2: Calculate Adrien's salary four years ago.
Adrien's salary four years ago = $40000
Step 3: Calculate Adrien's salary four years later.
Since Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later, we can calculate his salary by multiplying his salary four years ago by 1.4.
Adrien's salary four years later = Adrien's salary four years ago * 1.4
Adrien's salary four years later = $40000 * 1.4
Adrien's salary four years later = $56000

To find the total number of legs of the animals, we first need to determine the number of chickens and cows. Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can represent the number of cows as x and the number of chickens as 2x. We know that the total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation x + 2x = 60. Solving for x, we get 3x = 60, which gives us x = 20. Therefore, there are 20 cows and 2x = 40 chickens. Since cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs, the total number of legs is (20 x 4) + (40 x 2) = 80 + 80 = 160. The total number of legs of the animals on Farmer Brown's farm is 160.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we first need to determine the total number of employees the company will have after three months. Since the company hires 20 new employees every month, the total number of employees after three months will be the initial number of employees (200) plus the number of new employees hired (20 * 3 = 60). Therefore, the total number of employees after three months will be 200 + 60 = 260.
Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months. Since each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months will be the total number of employees (260) multiplied by the salary per employee ($4000). Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months will be 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.

To find out how many people were in the church next door, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. Since there were 100 guests and each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies, the total number of cookies is 100 x 15 = 1500. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door, which is 1/2 x 1500 = 750 cookies. Since each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, we can divide the total number of cookies given to the church (750) by the number of cookies each person got (15) to find the number of people in the church next door. 750 ÷ 15 = 50.

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the speed of a kangaroo. Since it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to travel across the highway, we can divide the total time by the number of kangaroos to find the time it would take for one kangaroo to make the trip.
                 18 hours / 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo
                 Now that we know the time it takes for one kangaroo to make the trip, we can determine the speed of a kangaroo. Since speed is equal to distance divided by time, and we know the time it takes for one kangaroo to make the trip, we can assume the distance is the same for all kangaroos.
                 Speed = Distance / Time
                 Speed = Distance / 6 hours
                 Since the distance is the same for all kangaroos, we can use the time it takes for one kangaroo to make the trip to find the speed of a kangaroo.

To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we first need to determine how many pieces Poppy and her mom have placed so far.

Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will make from each type of flower and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of money Artie will make from selling marigolds. He sells 12 pots of marigolds at $2.74 per pot. So, the total amount of money he will make from selling marigolds is 12 x $2.74 = $32.88.
                 Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Artie will make from selling petunias. He sells 9 pots of petunias at $1.87 per pot. So, the total amount of money he will make from selling petunias is 9 x $1.87 = $16.83.
                 Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money Artie will make from selling begonias. He sells 17 pots of begonias at $2.12 per pot. So, the total amount of money he will make from selling begonias is 17 x $2.12 = $36.04.
                 Now, let's add up the total amount of money Artie will make from each type of flower

To determine the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the total number of questions he completed and subtract that from the total number of questions on both tests.
                 For the first test, Mark had 8 hours to complete 75 questions at a rate of 5 questions per hour. We can calculate the number of questions he completed as follows:
                 8 hours * 5 questions/hour = 40 questions
                 For the second test, Mark had 6 hours to complete 100 questions at the same rate. We can calculate the number of questions he completed as follows:
                 6 hours * 5 questions/hour = 30 questions
                 The total number of questions Mark completed is the sum of the questions he completed on both tests:
                 40 questions + 30 questions = 70 questions
                 To find the number of questions Mark left incomplete, we subtract the total number of questions completed from the total number of questions on both tests:
                 75 questions + 100 questions = 175 questions
                 175 questions - 70 questions = 105 questions
                 Therefore, Mark left 105 questions incomplete.<|eot_id|>

To find the distance to their vacation spot, we first need to determine the speed at which they hiked. Since they hiked at an average of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed, we need to calculate half of their driving speed. Half of 50 miles per hour is 25 miles per hour. Since they hiked at 5 miles per hour less than that, their hiking speed was 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour. Now that we know their hiking speed, we can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance to their vacation spot. The time it took them to hike was 1.5 hours, so the distance is 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles. Therefore, their vacation spot was 30 miles away.<|eot_id|>

To determine the correct temperature setting for Maggie's oven, we need to calculate the percentage by which the oven is off. Since the oven is off by 468 - 450 = 18 degrees when set to 450, the percentage by which it is off is 18 / 450 = 0.04 or 4%. To find the correct temperature setting for a recipe that calls for 520 degrees, we need to calculate 4% of 520 and subtract it from 520. 4% of 520 is 0.04 x 520 = 20.8. Subtracting 20.8 from 520 gives us 520 - 20.8 = 499.2. Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to 499.2 degrees.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money will be remaining in Katina's savings account after 2 years, we need to calculate the total amount of money she will remove from the account in 2 years. Since she removes $100 from the account every month, we can multiply the monthly amount by the number of months in 2 years. There are 12 months in 1 year, so there are 24 months in 2 years. Therefore, the total amount of money she will remove from the account in 2 years is $100 x 24 = $2400. To find out how much money will be remaining in the account, we need to subtract the total amount of money she will remove from the initial amount of $3000. Therefore, the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years is $3000 - $2400 = $600. The answer is $600.<|eot_id|>

To find the time it took to cook all the food, we need to find the time it took to cook beans and pork. We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. Since it took 30 minutes to cook rice, and it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes. Since beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, it took 80 / 2 = 40 minutes to cook beans.

To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked by the team and then divide it by the number of painters.
First, we need to calculate the total number of hours worked by the team. Since the team worked for 3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks, we need to convert 3/8ths of a day to hours. There are 24 hours in a day, so 3/8ths of a day is equal to (3/8) x 24 = 9 hours.
Since the team worked for 3 weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours worked per day by the number of days in 3 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 3 weeks is equal to 3 x 7 = 21 days. Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is 9 hours/day x 21 days = 189 hours.
Now that we have the total number of hours worked by the team, we can divide it by the number of painters to find out how many hours of work each painter put in. There are 4 painters on the team, so we divide the total number of hours worked

To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we need to calculate the total amount of oats his horses consume in a day and then multiply it by the number of days.

To find the final price of Stephen's groceries, first calculate the 25% fee on the final bill of $40.00.  25% of $40.00 is 0.25 x $40.00 = $10.00.  Next, add the $10.00 fee to the final bill of $40.00.  $40.00 + $10.00 = $50.00.  Then, add the $3.00 delivery fee to $50.00.  $50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00.  Finally, add the $4.00 tip to $53.00.  $53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00.  Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries was $57.00.<|eot_id|>

To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to break down his journey into segments and calculate the distance covered in each segment.
First, John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 60 mph x 3 hours
Distance = 180 miles
Since John turns around, he is now 180 miles away from home.
Next, John tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. This means he drives for 2 hours at 0 mph (since he is not moving). The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 0 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 0 miles
So, after 2 hours, John is still 180 miles away from home.
Then, John spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. The distance covered in this segment is:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 mph x 0.5 hours
Distance = 15 miles
Now, John is 180 - 15 = 165 miles away from home.

To determine the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can, we need to consider the total number of sodas left and the number of shaken sodas remaining. Initially, there were 12 sodas in total. Ellen shook 3 of them up, leaving 9 unshaken sodas. She then took 1 unshaken soda for herself, leaving 8 unshaken sodas. Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, leaving 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas. Now, Ellen's friend comes along. There are 7 unshaken sodas and 2 shaken sodas left. The probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of shaken sodas divided by the total number of sodas remaining, which is 2/9. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: (2/9) * 100 = 22.22%. Therefore, the likelihood that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is approximately 22.22%.<|eot_id|>

In the first 6 hours, Debra saw 30 bees leave the hive. In the next 6 hours, she saw 1/2 that many bees return, which is 30 / 2 = 15 bees. In the next 6 hours, she saw two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave, which is 2 * 30 = 60 bees. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. This means that the 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours and the 15 bees that returned in the next 6 hours hadn't already returned, so 30 + 15 = 45 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.

To find out how many more weeks it will take Melanie to collect 200 toothpicks, we need to determine how many toothpicks she has already collected and how many more she needs. Melanie has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks, so she has saved a total of 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks. Since she needs 200 toothpicks in total, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks. To find out how many more weeks it will take her to collect the remaining toothpicks, we need to divide the number of toothpicks she still needs (80) by the number of toothpicks she saves each week (10). 80 / 10 = 8. Therefore, it will take Melanie 8 more weeks to collect 200 toothpicks.<|eot_id|>

To find the original length of the dress, we need to work backwards from the final length. We know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, and that it was extended by 50% of its original length. Let's call the original length of the dress "x". Since the dress was extended by 50% of its original length, we can say that the extended length is x + 0.5x = 1.5x. We also know that the extended length is 140cm, so we can set up the equation 1.5x = 140. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 1.5, which gives us x = 140/1.5 = 93.33cm. Therefore, the original length of the dress was approximately 93.33cm. Additionally, we know that 20cm was added to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim, so the original length of the dress would have been 93.33 - 20 = 73.33cm. Therefore, the original length of the dress was approximately 73.33cm.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many cards Kenny started with, we need to first determine how much money he made from selling his cards. We know that the amusement park costs $100 and he has $50 in spending cash, so he must have made $100 - $50 = $50 from selling his cards. Since he sells each card for $1.5, we can divide $50 by $1.5 to find out how many cards he sold. $50 ÷ $1.5 = 33.33. Since we can't sell a fraction of a card, we round down to 33 cards. We also know that Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, so he must have started with 3 times the number of cards he sold. 3 x 33 = 99. Therefore, Kenny started with 99 cards. The answer is 99.<|eot_id|>

To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to first calculate his total expenses. He needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths for each of his 8 clients (3 he already has, plus the 5 he is talking to). The cost of 2 bottles of bleach is 2 x $2 = $4.

To find out how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla, we need to first find out how many marbles Dallas had before he dropped 4 of them.  Dallas had 21 marbles after dropping 4, so he must have had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles before he dropped them.  Since Mazie gave 25 marbles to Dallas, she must have given 52 - 25 = 27 marbles to Darla.  Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. First, we need to find the total number of slices. Since there are 7 pizzas and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, the total number of slices is 7 x 8 = 56. Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and 3 of his friends), so we divide 56 by 4. 56 ÷ 4 = 14. Therefore, each person can have 14 slices.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Define the current ages of Duncan and Adam
Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.
## Step 2: Express Duncan's age eight years ago in terms of his current age
Duncan's age eight years ago can be expressed as D - 8.
## Step 3: Express Adam's age four years ago in terms of his current age
Adam's age four years ago can be expressed as A - 4.
## Step 4: Translate the given information into an equation
According to the problem, Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. This can be written as the equation: D - 8 = 2(A - 4).
## Step 5: Substitute Duncan's current age into the equation
We are given that Duncan's age is 60 now, so we substitute D = 60 into the equation: 60 - 8 = 2(A - 4).
## Step 6: Solve the equation for Adam's current age
Simplifying the equation: 52 = 2A - 8. Adding 8 to both sides: 60 = 2A. Dividing both sides by 2:

To find the total dollar amount in the jar, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the value of the quarters. There are 32 quarters in the jar, and each quarter is worth $0.25. So, the total value of the quarters is 32 x $0.25 = $8.00.
                 Next, let's calculate the value of the dimes. There are 95 dimes in the jar, and each dime is worth $0.10. So, the total value of the dimes is 95 x $0.10 = $9.50.

To calculate the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day, we first need to find out how many trucks were affected by the mechanical failures. Since a quarter of the number of lorries dispatched for delivery had mechanical failures, we need to calculate a quarter of 20.
                 A quarter of 20 is 20/4 = 5. This means that 5 trucks were affected by the mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilisers to the farmers.
                 Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total number of tons of fertiliser that could not be delivered is 5 * 20 = 100 tons.
                 To find the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers, we need to subtract the total number of tons of fertiliser that could not be delivered from the total number of tons of fertiliser that were dispatched.
                 The total number of tons of fertiliser that were dispatched is 20 * 20 = 400 tons.
                 Therefore, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is 400 - 100 = 300 tons.

Gabriel wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200 to help him. To find out how much money he still needs, we need to calculate the total cost of the items he wants to buy and subtract the amount of money he already has.
                The total cost of the items is $10000 (car) + $800 (phone) = $10600.
                Gabriel has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200, so the total amount of money he has is $5000 + $200 = $5200.
                To find out how much money he still needs, we subtract the amount of money he has from the total cost of the items: $10600 - $5200 = $5400.

To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total amount of money each machine will make in a month.
First, let's calculate the total number of widgets each machine will make in a month. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day, so it will make 60 x 24 = 1440 widgets per day. In a month with 30 days, it will make 1440 x 30 = 43,200 widgets. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour and runs 24 hours a day, so it will make 45 x 24 = 1080 widgets per day. In a month with 30 days, it will make 1080 x 30 = 32,400 widgets.
Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money each machine will make in a month. Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43,200 x $6 = $259,200 in a month. The WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32,400 x $6 = $192,000 in a month

To calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day, we need to add up the number of people who entered at each time.
                 First, 50 people entered in the morning. Then, at 10:00, 40 more people entered, making the total 50 + 40 = 90 people.
                 Next, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. Since 40 people entered at 10:00, twice that number is 40 * 2 = 80 people. So, the total number of people now is 90 + 80 = 170 people.
                 Finally, by evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Since 50 people entered in the morning, 3 times that number is 50 * 3 = 150 people. So, the total number of people now is 170 + 150 = 320 people.

To calculate the total cost of John's purchases, we need to first calculate the total cost of the non-food items.  The non-food items are the light bulbs, cups, and roach traps.  The total cost of these items is 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars.  Since there is a 10% tax on these items, we need to calculate 10% of 10 dollars.  10% of 10 dollars is 1 dollar.  So the total cost of the non-food items is 10 + 1 = 11 dollars.  Now we need to calculate the total cost of the food items.  The food items are the milk and eggs.  The total cost of these items is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.  Finally, we need to add the total cost of the non-food items and the total cost of the food items.  The total cost is 11 + 5 = 16 dollars.

We can do this by subtracting the amount she has already saved ($4 x 8 = $32) from the total amount she wants to save ($60). $60 - $32 = $28. Since she saves $4 per week, we can divide $28 by $4 to find out how many more weeks it will take for her to reach her goal. $28 ÷ $4 = 7. Therefore, it will take Jane 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money James was out, we need to first calculate the total cost of the CDs.  He bought 10 CDs at $15 each, so the total cost is 10 x $15 = $150.  Since he got them for 40% off, we need to calculate 40% of $150.  40% of $150 is 0.4 x $150 = $60.  So the total cost of the CDs after the discount is $150 - $60 = $90.  He sold 5 of the CDs for $40 each, so he made 5 x $40 = $200.  To find out how much money he was out, we need to subtract the amount he made from the total cost of the CDs after the discount.  $200 - $90 = $110.  Therefore, James was out $110.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it took Chris to mow the lawn, we need to calculate the time it took him to mow half of the lawn in "turtle" mode and half of the lawn in "rabbit" mode. Since he can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour (60 minutes) in "turtle" mode, he can mow half of the lawn in 30 minutes. In "rabbit" mode, he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes, so he can mow half of the lawn in 20 minutes. To find the total time, we need to add the time it took him to mow half of the lawn in "turtle" mode (30 minutes) and half of the lawn in "rabbit" mode (20 minutes). The total time is 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. Therefore, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to add up the time he spends on his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. The total time spent on homework is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. Since John has 3 hours before he has to eat dinner, we need to convert 3 hours to minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so 3 hours is equal to 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. To find out how many minutes John has to nap, we need to subtract the time spent on homework from the total time available. 180 - 80 = 100 minutes. Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap. The answer is 100 minutes.<|eot_id|>

To find the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle, we need to find the total square footage of the sandcastle and divide it by the number of levels. The top level has a square footage of 16. Since each level has half the square footage as the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level as follows:
                 Level 1: 16
                 Level 2: 16 / 2 = 8
                 Level 3: 8 / 2 = 4
                 Level 4: 4 / 2 = 2
                 The total square footage of the sandcastle is 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30. Since there are 4 levels, the average square footage of each level is 30 / 4 = 7.5. Therefore, the average square footage of each level of the sandcastle is 7.5.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we need to calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on both days and then find the difference between the two times.
                 First, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a cold day. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes, he will swim 3 miles in 3 x 16 = 48 minutes.
                 Now, let's calculate the time it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day. We know that he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as on a cold day. Since he swims a mile in 16 minutes on a cold day, he will swim a mile in 2 + (2 x 16) = 2 + 32 = 34 minutes on a hot day. Therefore, he will swim 3 miles in 3 x 34 = 102 minutes.
                 To find the difference between the two times, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day: 102 - 48 = 54 minutes. Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on

Since Mike is paying with a $50.00 bill, we need to subtract the discounted price from the $50.00 bill.  $50.00 - $30.00 = $20.00.  Therefore, Mike will have $20.00 left over.  The answer is $20.00.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many slices of pizza were left, we need to calculate the total number of slices first. Since each pizza has 12 slices and there are 5 pizzas in total, the total number of slices is 5 x 12 = 60.
                 Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas, which means they ate 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices each. Since there are 3 of them, they ate a total of 3 x 8 = 24 slices.
                 The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which means they ate ¾ x 12 = 9 slices each. Since there are 2 of them, they ate a total of 2 x 9 = 18 slices.
                 The total number of slices eaten is 24 + 18 = 42. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices: 60 - 42 = 18. Therefore, 18 slices of pizza were left.<|eot_id|>

To find the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device, we first need to calculate her weekly electric bill before and after the addition of the new device.
First, let's calculate her weekly electric bill before the addition of the new device. Her daily consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour, so her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 kilowatts per hour. Since a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, her weekly electric bill before the addition of the new device is 84 * $1.50 = $126.
Next, let's calculate her weekly electric bill after the addition of the new device. Her daily consumption is now 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour, so her weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 kilowatts per hour. Since a kilowatt per hour is $1.50, her weekly electric bill after the addition of the new device is 98 * $1.50 = $147.
The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is $147 - $126 = $21.
Therefore, the difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the

## Step 1: Define variables for Ruby's and Sam's current ages
Let's denote Ruby's current age as R and Sam's current age as S.
## Step 2: Express Ruby's age in terms of Sam's age
Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can express Ruby's age as R = 6S.
## Step 3: Express Ruby's age in 9 years in terms of Sam's age in 9 years
In 9 years, Ruby's age will be R + 9 and Sam's age will be S + 9. According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can express this relationship as R + 9 = 3(S + 9).
## Step 4: Substitute R from step 2 into the equation from step 3
Substituting R = 6S into the equation R + 9 = 3(S + 9), we get 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9).
## Step 5: Solve the equation for S
Expanding the equation 6S + 9 = 3(S + 9), we get 6S + 9

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.  The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.  He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. To find out how much he spent on ties, we need to calculate the cost of the red ties first. Since the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, we can multiply the cost of the blue ties by 1.5 to get the cost of the red ties. 1.5 x $40 = $60. Since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 x 200 = 400 red ties. The total cost of the red ties is 400 x $60 = $24,000. To find the total cost of the ties, we need to add the cost of the blue ties to the cost of the red ties. $200 + $24,000 = $24,200. Therefore, John spent $24,200 on ties.<|eot_id|>

To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we need to calculate the interest she earns each year and add it to the original amount. Since the interest rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year, we can calculate the interest for each year as follows:
Year 1: Interest = (3/4) * $300 = $225
Total Amount = $300 + $225 = $525
Year 2: Interest = (3/4) * $525 = $396.75
Total Amount = $525 + $396.75 = $921.75
Year 3: Interest = (3/4) * $921.75 = $693.53
Total Amount = $921.75 + $693.53 = $1,615.28

To find out how many shoes Fireman Frank will have on Sunday, we need to calculate the total number of shoes he has before getting rid of 180 shoes on Saturday.
                 First, let's calculate the total number of shoes Fireman Frank gets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. He gets 5 pairs on Monday, 15 pairs on Wednesday, and 30 pairs on Friday. So, the total number of shoes he gets is 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 pairs.
                 Since each pair has 2 shoes, the total number of shoes he gets is 50 * 2 = 100 shoes.
                 Now, let's add the shoes he already has to the shoes he gets. He already has 200 shoes, and he gets 100 more. So, the total number of shoes he has is 200 + 100 = 300 shoes.
                 Finally, let's subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday. He gets rid of 180 shoes. So, the total number of shoes he has on Sunday is 300 - 180 = 120 shoes.

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we first need to determine the current ages of Darrell and Allen. Since their ages are in the ratio of 7:11, we can let Darrell's age be 7x and Allen's age be 11x. The sum of their ages is 162, so we can set up the equation 7x + 11x = 162. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162. Dividing both sides by 18, we find that x = 9. Therefore, Darrell's age is 7x = 7(9) = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11(9) = 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109. Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.<|eot_id|>

Since Manny's parents won't sign him up again if the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to find out how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.

To find the number of pieces Tracy obtained, we need to divide the total length of the wire (4 feet) by the length of each piece (6 inches). First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches. Now, we can divide the total length of the wire (48 inches) by the length of each piece (6 inches). 48 ÷ 6 = 8. Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of apples Newton brought home, let's break down the sequence of events:
                 Initially, Newton picked up 2 apples, put 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 apple into the tree.  This resulted in 5 more apples falling out of the tree.  So, the total number of apples at this point is 2 (initial apples) + 5 (apples that fell out) = 7 apples.
                 Next, Newton picked up these 7 apples, put all but 1 in his pocket, and threw 1 apple back into the tree.  This resulted in 6 more apples falling out of the tree.  So, the total number of apples at this point is 7 (previous apples) + 6 (apples that fell out) = 13 apples.
                 Finally, Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  Therefore, he brought home a total of 13 apples.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we need to calculate the number of times it rang each time it went off and then add them together.
                 The first time it went off, it rang 4 times.
                 The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time. Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang 3 * 4 = 12 times.
                 The third time it went off, it rang for half as long as the second time. Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.
                 To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add the number of times it rang each time it went off: 4 + 12 + 6 = 22.

To determine the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake, we need to calculate the total time it takes to make the cake.  The total time is the sum of the time to make the cake batter, the time to bake the cake, the time to cool the cake, and the time to frost the cake.  The time to make the cake batter is 20 minutes, the time to bake the cake is 30 minutes, the time to cool the cake is 2 hours or 120 minutes, and the time to frost the cake is 10 minutes.  Therefore, the total time to make the cake is 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the total time to make the cake is 180/60 = 3 hours.  Therefore, the latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 pm is 5:00 pm - 3 hours = 2:00 pm.  The latest time of day that Jordan can start making the cake is 2:00 pm.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to calculate the distance between these two points. We know that his first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total distance of the trip was 60 miles, we can find the distance between the two stops by subtracting the distance of the first stop from the total distance and then subtracting 15 miles from that result.
                 Distance between first and second stops = Total distance - Distance of first stop - 15 miles
                 Distance between first and second stops = 60 miles - 20 miles - 15 miles
                 Distance between first and second stops = 25 miles

To calculate the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to first calculate the total cost of the gas before the cashback rewards.  The cost of 10 gallons of gas at $3.00 per gallon is 10 x $3.00 = $30.00.  Next, we need to calculate the total cashback rewards.  The cashback rewards are $0.20 per gallon, so for 10 gallons of gas, the total cashback rewards are 10 x $0.20 = $2.00.  Finally, we need to subtract the total cashback rewards from the total cost of the gas to get the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards.  Therefore, the total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.  The total cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take for everyone to try the escape room, we need to calculate the total amount of time it will take for all 10 students in each grade to try the escape room. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of students that can try the escape room at a time. There are 3 grades with 10 students in each grade, so there are a total of 3 x 10 = 30 students. Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, we need to divide 30 by 8. 30 ÷ 8 = 3.75. Since we can't have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. 3.75 rounded up is 4. Since 4 groups of 8 students can try the escape room at a time, it will take 4 x 45 minutes for everyone to try the escape room. 4 x 45 = 180 minutes.

To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the initial number of occupied beds
The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, the initial number of occupied beds is 1000 * (1/5) = 200 beds.
Step 2: Calculate the initial number of unoccupied beds
The initial number of unoccupied beds is the total capacity minus the initial number of occupied beds. So, the initial number of unoccupied beds is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.
Step 3: Calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks
Since 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.
Step 4: Calculate the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks
The total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is the initial number of occupied beds plus the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks. So, the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long, which is 5 * 2 = 10 minutes.  The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, which is 5 / 2 = 2.5 minutes.  The total time is 5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 minutes.  Therefore, it takes John 30 minutes to get all 6 sides of the Rubik's cube.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of leftover burritos, we first need to calculate the total number of burritos given to the students. Since there were 50 students and each student was given 10 burritos, the total number of burritos given to the students is 50 * 10 = 500 burritos.
                 Next, we need to subtract the number of burritos eaten by Mr. George from the total number of burritos given to the students. Since Mr. George ate 20 burritos, the total number of leftover burritos is 500 - 20 = 480 burritos.
                 Therefore, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is 480.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many blueberry cubes Mary makes, we first need to determine how many strawberry cubes she makes. Let's call the number of strawberry cubes "x". Since she makes a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes can be expressed as 5x - 4. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, so we can set up the equation x + (5x - 4) = 116. Solving for x, we get 6x - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6x = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get x = 20. Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, the number of blueberry cubes is 5(20) - 4 = 96 - 4 = 92. Therefore, Mary makes 92 blueberry cubes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pounds of insects the ducks need per day, we need to divide the total amount of insects they need per week (3.5 pounds) by the number of days in a week (7 days).
                3.5 pounds / 7 days = 0.5 pounds per day
                Since there is a flock of ten ducks, we need to multiply the amount of insects per day by the number of ducks.
                0.5 pounds per day * 10 ducks = 5 pounds per day

To find the net profit of the food truck, we need to calculate the total revenue, total cost, and then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.
                 First, let's calculate the total revenue.  The food truck sells 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, so the total revenue is 10 x $7.00 = $70.00.
                 Next, let's calculate the total cost.  The food truck spends $30.00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.  They also spend $3.00 per loaf of bread, and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so they need 1 loaf of bread for 10 sandwiches.  The total cost is $30.00 + $3.00 = $33.00.
                 Now, let's calculate the net profit.  The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.  So, the net profit is $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.
                 Therefore, the net profit of the food truck is $37.00.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many old records the 5 people brought in, we need to figure out how many new records they got and then work backwards to find out how many old records they brought in.
                 Since 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record, we can divide the total number of new records by 2 to find out how many old records were traded.
                 7 new records / 2 old records per new record = 3.5 old records per person
                 Since you can't trade half a record, we'll round down to 3 old records per person.
                 5 people * 3 old records per person = 15 old records

To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to calculate how much money she has left after she pays for the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and the two go-kart rides.
                 First, let's calculate the total cost of the mini-golf, arcade tokens, and the two go-kart rides. The cost of the mini-golf is $5, the arcade tokens are $5, and the two go-kart rides are 2 x $10 = $20. So the total cost is $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.
                 Now, let's subtract the total cost from Morgan's budget of $90. $90 - $30 = $60.
                 Since each friend will play one round of mini-golf, get $5 in arcade tokens, and ride the go-karts twice, each friend will cost $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.
                 To find out how many friends Morgan can invite, we need to divide the amount of money she has left ($60) by the cost of each friend ($30). $60 ÷ $30 = 2.

Since Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, Alex has caught 4x - 13 + 5 Pokemon.  The total number of Pokemon caught is the sum of the Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe, which is x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5) = 339.  Combining like terms, we get 9x - 13 = 339.

To determine the cost of everything, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee and the donut separately and then add them together.
                 First, we need to calculate the cost of the coffee.  Since Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day, he needs 7 pounds of coffee for a week.  The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.  However, the more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.  20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.  Since Roger needs 7 pounds of coffee, the total cost of the coffee is 7 x $6 = $42.
                 Next, we need to calculate the cost of the donut.  The donut costs $2.
                 Finally, we need to add the cost of the coffee and the donut together to get the total cost.  The total cost is $42 + $2 = $44.
                 Therefore, everything cost $44.<|eot_id|>

## Step 1: Calculate the total amount of water the two girls got
The two girls each got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water, so together they got 2 * (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3 of the water.
## Step 2: Calculate the amount of water left after the girls got their share
Since the girls got 1/3 of the water, the amount of water left is 24 - 1/3 = 24 * (2/3) = 48/3 = 16 liters.
## Step 3: Calculate the amount of water left after the boy got his share
The boy got 6 liters of water, so the amount of water left is 16 - 6 = 10 liters.
The final answer is: $\boxed{10}$<|eot_id|>

To find out how many scoops of ice cream Erin should buy, we need to calculate how many scoops she can buy with $6.00.  Since each scoop costs $1.50, we can divide $6.00 by $1.50 to find out how many scoops she can buy.  $6.00 ÷ $1.50 = 4 scoops.  Since the deal is buy 2 scoops, get 1 scoop free, Erin can buy 2 scoops and get 2 scoops free.  Therefore, Erin should buy 2 scoops of ice cream.  She will get 2 scoops of ice cream for free.  Erin will spend $3.00 on 2 scoops of ice cream.  She will have $3.00 left over.  Erin should buy 2 scoops of ice cream.  She will get 2 scoops of ice cream for free.

To determine the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to calculate the total distance traveled by the bird in each direction and then find the difference between the two distances.
First, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled flying south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour x 10 hours
Distance = 300 miles
Next, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled flying north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour x 2 hours
Distance = 36 miles
Finally, let's calculate the distance the bird traveled flying south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour x 5 hours
Distance = 110 miles
To find the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we need to find the difference between the distance traveled flying south and the distance traveled flying north:
Total Distance = Distance Traveled Flying South - Distance Traveled Flying North
Total Distance = 300 miles - 36 miles
Total Distance = 264 miles

To find out how many cats were left on the rock, we first need to determine how many cats were taken away by the boats. Since there were 50 cats initially and 4 boats took 5 cats each, the total number of cats taken away by the boats is 4 * 5 = 20 cats.
                 After the boats took away 20 cats, there were 50 - 20 = 30 cats left on the rock.
                 Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after a mouse. To find 3/5 of 30, we multiply 30 by 3/5, which is (30 * 3) / 5 = 90 / 5 = 18. So, 18 cats ran after the mouse.
                 Finally, to find out how many cats were left on the rock, we subtract the number of cats that ran after the mouse from the number of cats that remained after the boats took away the cats. So, 30 - 18 = 12 cats were left on the rock.

## Step 1: Define the relationship between Janey's and Sally's books
Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. This can be represented as J = 2S + 3, where J is the number of books Janey has and S is the number of books Sally has.
## Step 2: Substitute the known value of Janey's books into the equation
Since Janey has 21 books, we can substitute J = 21 into the equation: 21 = 2S + 3.
## Step 3: Solve the equation for S
To solve for S, we first subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 21 - 3 = 2S + 3 - 3, which simplifies to 18 = 2S.
## Step 4: Find the value of S
Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate S: 18 / 2 = 2S / 2, which simplifies to 9 = S.
The final answer is: $\boxed{9}$<|eot_id|>

To determine the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we need to calculate the length of each wolf's howl and then add them together.
                 First, we know that Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Since Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.
                 Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.
                 To find the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls, we add the length of each wolf's howl together: 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.
                 Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert 120 seconds to minutes by dividing by 60: 120 / 60 = 2 minutes.

To find out how much Daniel has to spend on all the items he wants to buy, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items before the discount. The cost of five notebooks is 5 * $1.50 = $7.50.

To find out how much you will save if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream and the total cost of the milk, and then subtract the total cost from the original price of the ice cream and milk.
                 The original price of 2 tubs of ice cream is $13 x 2 = $26. The discounted price of 2 tubs of ice cream is $11 x 2 = $22. So, you will save $26 - $22 = $4 on the ice cream.
                 The original price of 4 packets of milk is $0.5 x 4 = $2. The discounted price of 4 packets of milk is $0.5 x 4 = $2. So, you will save $2 - $2 = $0 on the milk.

To find the cost of the whole phone plan, we need to calculate the cost of the main phone and the cost of the four additional phones. Since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone, the cost of each additional phone is $20 / 2 = $10. The cost of the four additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40. The cost of the whole phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the four additional phones, which is $20 + $40 = $60. Therefore, the whole phone plan costs $60.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many eggs are still hidden in the yard, we need to find out how many eggs each person found and then subtract that number from the total number of eggs that Cole hid.
                 Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.
                 Lamar finds 5 eggs.
                 Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.
                 Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.
                 Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.
                 To find the total number of eggs found, we need to add the number of eggs found by each person: 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.
                 To find the number of eggs still hidden, we need to subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs that Cole hid: 36 - 27 = 9 eggs.
                 Therefore, 9 eggs are still hidden in the yard.<|eot_id|>

Theo bought a pen for $2 and a piece of paper that cost $1 less than three times the price of the pen. Three times the price of the pen is 3 x $2 = $6. $1 less than $6 is $6 - $1 = $5. The total cost of the pen and the paper is $2 + $5 = $7. Theo gave the cashier $10. The amount of change she received is $10 - $7 = $3. The answer is $3.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Tommy raises, we need to calculate the total amount of money he raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes separately, and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies. Since each brownie costs $3 and he sells 43 brownies, the total amount of money he raises from selling brownies is 43 x $3 = $129.
Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling cheesecakes. Since each cheesecake costs $4 and he sells 23 slices of cheesecake, the total amount of money he raises from selling cheesecakes is 23 x $4 = $92.
Now, let's add the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes together. $129 + $92 = $221.
Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many eggs the friends found, we need to subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs and then subtract the 10 eggs that were not found by their friends.
                 Total eggs = 100
                 Eggs found by Smith twins = 30 x 2 = 60
                 Eggs found by friends = Total eggs - Eggs found by Smith twins = 100 - 60 = 40
                 Eggs not found by friends = 10
                 Eggs found by friends = Eggs found by friends - Eggs not found by friends = 40 - 10 = 30
                 Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.<|eot_id|>
