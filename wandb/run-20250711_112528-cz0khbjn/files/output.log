To find the number of new books Sam bought, we need to subtract the number of books he used from the total number of books he bought.
                 Total number of books bought = 13 (adventure books) + 17 (mystery books) = 30
                 Number of books used = 15
                 Number of new books bought = Total number of books bought - Number of books used
                 Number of new books bought = 30 - 15
                 Number of new books bought = 15
                 Therefore, Sam bought 15 new books.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many small gardens Bianca had, we need to first find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens. We know that she planted 40 seeds in the big garden. We also know that she planted 2 seeds in each small garden. To find out how many small gardens she had, we need to divide the number of seeds she planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds she planted in each small garden. Since she started with 52 seeds and planted 40 in the big garden, she must have planted 52 - 40 = 12 seeds in the small gardens. To find out how many small gardens she had, we need to divide 12 by 2. 12 / 2 = 6. Therefore, Bianca had 6 small gardens.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many folders Paige ended up with, we need to first find out how many files she had left after deleting 9 of them. We can do this by subtracting 9 from 27. 27 - 9 = 18. Now that we know she had 18 files left, we can divide 18 by 6 to find out how many folders she ended up with. 18 ÷ 6 = 3. Therefore, Paige ended up with 3 folders.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of tables the waiter had, we first need to find out how many customers were left after 12 of them left.
                 21 (initial customers) - 12 (customers who left) = 9
                 Since the rest of the tables had 3 people at each table, we can divide the remaining customers by 3 to find the number of tables.
                 9 (remaining customers) ÷ 3 (customers per table) = 3

To find out how many cages the pet store used, we need to divide the number of puppies left after the sale by the number of puppies that can fit in each cage.
                 The pet store started with 56 puppies and sold 24, so they had 56 - 24 = 32 puppies left.
                 Since each cage can hold 4 puppies, we can divide 32 by 4 to find out how many cages were used.
                 32 ÷ 4 = 8
                 Therefore, the pet store used 8 cages to put the remaining puppies into.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows, we first need to find out how many windows are left to be installed. The total number of windows needed is 10, and the builder has already installed 6 of them. So, the number of windows left to be installed is 10 - 6 = 4.
Since it takes 5 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of windows left to be installed by the time it takes to install each window to find the total time it will take to install the rest of the windows.
4 windows * 5 hours/window = 20 hours
Therefore, it will take the builder 20 hours to install the rest of the windows.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of students in each group, we first need to find out how many students were picked for the team. Since there are 17 students in total and 5 didn't get picked, the number of students picked for the team is 17 - 5 = 12.
Next, we divide the number of students picked for the team (12) by the number of groups (3) to find out how many students would be in each group.
12 ÷ 3 = 4
Therefore, there would be 4 students in each group.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted, we need to calculate the total number of puppies at the shelter and then divide that number by the number of puppies adopted each day.
                 The total number of puppies at the shelter is 17 (initial puppies) + 55 (additional puppies) = 72 puppies.
                 Since 8 puppies are adopted each day, we can divide the total number of puppies (72) by the number of puppies adopted each day (8).
                 72 ÷ 8 = 9

To find out how long the money will last Luke, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. He made 9 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating, so the total amount of money he has is 9 + 18 = 27 dollars.
                 Since Luke only spends 3 dollars a week, we can divide the total amount of money he has (27 dollars) by the amount he spends per week (3 dollars) to find out how many weeks the money will last.
                 27 dollars / 3 dollars per week = 9 weeks.

Since she needs 5 cups of flour for each of the 5 brownies, the total amount of flour she needs is 5 x 5 = 25 cups. To find out how much flour she still needs, we need to subtract the amount of flour she used (15 cups) from the total amount of flour she needs (25 cups). 25 - 15 = 10 cups.

To determine the number of vases needed, we need to calculate the total number of flowers. Since a vase can hold 5 flowers, we can divide the total number of flowers by 5.
                 Total number of flowers = 6 carnations + 19 roses = 25 flowers.
                 Number of vases needed = Total number of flowers / 5 = 25 / 5 = 5 vases.
                 Therefore, you would need 5 vases to hold all the flowers.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and then divide that number by the number of puppies adopted per day.
                 The pet shelter initially had 3 puppies. Another 3 puppies were brought in, so the total number of puppies is 3 + 3 = 6.
                 Since 3 puppies are adopted per day, we divide the total number of puppies (6) by the number of puppies adopted per day (3).

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to first find out how many problems she has already graded. Since there are 2 problems on each worksheet and she has already graded 7 worksheets, we can multiply the number of worksheets she has already graded by the number of problems on each worksheet.
                 7 worksheets * 2 problems per worksheet = 14 problems
                 Next, we need to find out how many problems she has left to grade. We can do this by subtracting the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems.
                 Total number of problems = 14 worksheets * 2 problems per worksheet = 28 problems
                 Number of problems already graded = 14 problems
                 Number of problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Number of problems already graded

To find out how much money the waiter earned, we need to first find out how many customers left a tip. Since there were 10 customers in total and 5 of them didn't leave a tip, the number of customers who left a tip is 10 - 5 = 5.
                 Since each of the 5 customers who left a tip gave the waiter $3, the total amount of money the waiter earned is 5 x $3 = $15.
                 Therefore, the waiter earned $15.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many 8 dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the cost of the new mower blades from the total amount of money he made.
                 Mike made 42 dollars and spent 10 dollars, so he has 42 - 10 = 32 dollars left.
                 Since each game costs 8 dollars, we can divide the amount of money Mike has left (32 dollars) by the cost of each game (8 dollars) to find out how many games he can buy.
                 32 ÷ 8 = 4
                 Therefore, Mike can buy 4 games with the money he had left.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many chicken wings each person would get, we need to divide the total number of chicken wings by the number of people in the group. The total number of chicken wings is 8 + 10 = 18. There are 3 people in the group.
                 18 ÷ 3 = 6
                 Therefore, each person in the group would get 6 chicken wings.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many players were on Emily's team, we need to subtract the points scored by Emily from the total points scored by the team. This will give us the points scored by the rest of the team.

To find out how many cages the pet store used, we need to divide the number of remaining puppies by the number of puppies that can fit in each cage.
                 The pet store started with 78 puppies. After selling 30, they had 78 - 30 = 48 puppies left.
                 Since each cage can hold 8 puppies, we can divide 48 by 8 to find out how many cages were used.
                 48 ÷ 8 = 6
                 Therefore, the pet store used 6 cages to put the remaining puppies into.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many shirts Oliver did not wash, we need to subtract the number of shirts he washed (20) from the total number of shirts he had to wash (39 + 47 = 86).
                 86 (total shirts) - 20 (shirts washed) = 66
                 Therefore, Oliver did not wash 66 shirts.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many folders Katie ended up with, we need to divide the number of remaining files by the number of files in each folder.
                 Katie started with 85 files and deleted 40, so she had 85 - 40 = 45 files left.
                 Since each folder has 5 files, we can divide 45 by 5 to find the number of folders.
                 45 ÷ 5 = 9
                 Therefore, Katie ended up with 9 folders.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pieces of candy Haley has now, we need to subtract the number of pieces she ate the first night (17) from the total number of pieces she scored (33), and then add the number of pieces her sister gave her (19).

To calculate the cost for the group to eat, first determine the number of adults. Since there are 12 people in the group and 7 are kids, the number of adults is 12 - 7 = 5. Since each adult meal costs $3, multiply the number of adults (5) by the cost of an adult meal ($3) to find the total cost for the adults.
                 5 x $3 = $15
                 Since kids eat free, there is no additional cost for the kids.
                 The total cost for the group to eat is $15.
                 Alternatively, you can calculate the total cost by multiplying the total number of people (12) by the cost of an adult meal ($3).
                 12 x $3 = $36

To determine how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the total time required to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.
                 Total number of pictures = 7 + 13 = 20
                 Number of albums = 5
                 Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums
                 Number of pictures in each album = 20 / 5
                 Number of pictures in each album = 4
                 Therefore, there are 4 pictures in each of the 5 albums.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Kaleb still has, we need to subtract the number of boxes he gave away (5) from the total number of boxes he bought (14).
                 14 (total boxes) - 5 (boxes given away) = 9
                 Since each box has 6 pieces of candy, we need to multiply the number of boxes Kaleb still has (9) by the number of pieces per box (6).
                 9 (remaining boxes) * 6 (pieces per box) = 54
                 Therefore, Kaleb still has 54 pieces of chocolate candy.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many problems are on each page, we need to divide the total number of problems by the number of pages.
                 Total number of problems = 55
                 Number of pages = 7
                 Number of problems per page = Total number of problems ÷ Number of pages
                 Number of problems per page = 55 ÷ 7
                 Number of problems per page = 7.86
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a problem, we can round the answer to the nearest whole number.
                 Number of problems per page ≈ 8

To find out how much money Adam actually earned, we need to multiply the number of lawns he mowed (4) by the amount of money he earned for each lawn (9 dollars).

To find the total number of lives the remaining players had, we need to multiply the number of remaining players by the number of lives each player had.
                 First, we need to find the number of remaining players by subtracting the number of players who quit from the total number of players.
                 Total players = 13
                 Players who quit = 8
                 Remaining players = Total players - Players who quit
                 Remaining players = 13 - 8
                 Remaining players = 5
                 Now that we know the number of remaining players, we can multiply it by the number of lives each player had.
                 Lives per player = 6
                 Total lives = Remaining players * Lives per player
                 Total lives = 5 * 6
                 Total lives = 30
                 Therefore, the remaining players had a total of 30 lives.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many 6 dollar games Mike could buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the cost of the new mower blades from the total amount of money Mike made.
                 101 - 47 = 54
                 Since each game costs 6 dollars, we can divide the amount of money Mike has left by the cost of each game.
                 54 ÷ 6 = 9

To determine the number of cupcakes Mike should buy, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the party. Mike invited 13 friends, but 7 couldn't come, so the total number of people attending is 13 - 7 = 6. Since each person should have exactly 4 cupcakes, Mike should buy 6 x 4 = 24 cupcakes. Therefore, Mike should buy 24 cupcakes for the party.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many bouquets Isabel could still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked.
                 Total flowers = 66
                 Wilted flowers = 10
                 Remaining flowers = Total flowers - Wilted flowers

                 Remaining flowers = 56
                 Since each bouquet requires 8 flowers, we can divide the remaining flowers by 8 to find out how many bouquets she can make.
                 Number of bouquets = Remaining flowers / 8
                 Number of bouquets = 56 / 8

To find out how many songs Paige has on her mp3 player, we need to subtract the number of old songs she deleted (5) from the total number of songs she originally had (8), and then add the number of new songs she added (30).
                 8 (original songs) - 5 (old songs deleted) = 3
                 3 + 30 (new songs added) = 33
                 Therefore, Paige now has 33 songs on her mp3 player.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Edward actually earned, we need to calculate how much he would have earned if he had mowed all 6 lawns, and then subtract the amount he would have earned for the 2 lawns he forgot to mow.
                 First, let's calculate how much he would have earned if he had mowed all 6 lawns. Since he earns 9 dollars for each lawn, we multiply 9 dollars by 6 lawns: 9 x 6 = 54 dollars.
                 Next, we need to calculate how much he would have earned for the 2 lawns he forgot to mow. Since he earns 9 dollars for each lawn, we multiply 9 dollars by 2 lawns: 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.
                 Finally, we subtract the amount he would have earned for the 2 lawns he forgot to mow from the amount he would have earned if he had mowed all 6 lawns: 54 dollars - 18 dollars = 36 dollars.

To find out how many pastries Katie sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries she took back home (8) from the total number of pastries she made (7 cupcakes + 5 cookies = 12 pastries).
                 12 pastries - 8 pastries = 4 pastries
                 Katie sold 4 pastries at the school bake sale.
                 Alternatively, we can calculate the number of pastries she sold by subtracting the number of pastries she took back home from the total number of pastries she made:
                 Total pastries made = 7 cupcakes + 5 cookies = 12 pastries
                 Pastries taken back home = 8 pastries
                 Pastries sold = Total pastries made - Pastries taken back home
                 Pastries sold = 12 pastries - 8 pastries
                 Pastries sold = 4 pastries
                 Therefore, Katie sold 4 pastries at the school bake sale.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much flour Tiffany still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of flour required for 17 brownies. Since each brownie requires 8 cups of flour, we can multiply the number of brownies needed (17) by the amount of flour per brownie (8).

                 Since Tiffany already used 8 x 8 = 64 cups of flour for the 8 brownies she baked, we need to subtract this amount from the total amount of flour required (136).

To find out how many oranges are in the bin, we need to subtract the number of old oranges that were thrown away (37) from the total number of oranges (40), and then add the number of new oranges that were put in the bin (7).
                 40 (total oranges) - 37 (old oranges thrown away) = 3
                 3 (remaining oranges) + 7 (new oranges) = 10
                 Therefore, there are 10 oranges in the bin.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many 6 dollar toys Will could buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the cost of the new game from his initial amount of money.
                 57 - 27 = 30
                 Since each toy costs 6 dollars, we can divide 30 by 6 to find out how many toys Will could buy.
                 30 ÷ 6 = 5

To find out how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to first find out how many problems she has already graded. Since there are 3 problems on each worksheet and she has already graded 7 worksheets, we can multiply the number of problems per worksheet by the number of worksheets she has already graded.
                 3 problems per worksheet * 7 worksheets = 21 problems
                 Since the teacher has already graded 21 problems, we need to find out how many problems she has left to grade. To do this, we need to subtract the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems.
                 Total number of problems = 3 problems per worksheet * 15 worksheets = 45 problems
                 Number of problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Number of problems already graded
                 45 problems - 21 problems = 24 problems

                 Now, let's add the total number of scarves and mittens together to find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Chloe had. 8 (scarves) + 24 (mittens) = 32.
                 Therefore, Chloe had a total of 32 pieces of winter clothing.<|eot_id|>

                 Since each pie takes 8 apples, we can divide the remaining apples by 8 to find out how many pies they can make.
                 56 (remaining apples) ÷ 8 (apples per pie) = 7 pies
                 Therefore, the cafeteria can make 7 pies with the remaining apples.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of students in each group, we first need to find out how many students were picked for the team. Since 9 students didn't get picked, we subtract 9 from the total number of students.
                 36 (total students) - 9 (students not picked) = 27 (students picked)
                 Now that we know 27 students were picked for the team, we need to divide them into 3 groups.
                 27 (students picked) ÷ 3 (groups) = 9 (students per group)

To find out how many small gardens Haley had, we need to first find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens. We know that she planted 35 seeds in the big garden. Since she started with 56 seeds, she must have planted 56 - 35 = 21 seeds in the small gardens. Since she planted 3 seeds in each small garden, we can divide 21 by 3 to find out how many small gardens she had. 21 ÷ 3 = 7. Therefore, Haley had 7 small gardens.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more problems the teacher has to grade, we need to first find out how many problems she has already graded. Since there are 7 problems on each worksheet and she has already graded 8 worksheets, we can multiply the number of problems per worksheet by the number of worksheets she has already graded.

                 Next, we need to find out how many problems she has left to grade. We can do this by subtracting the number of problems she has already graded from the total number of problems.
                 Total number of problems = 7 problems per worksheet * 17 worksheets = 119 problems
                 Number of problems left to grade = Total number of problems - Number of problems already graded

To determine how long it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows, we first need to find out how many windows are left to be installed. The total number of windows needed is 11, and the builder has already installed 4 of them. So, the number of windows left to be installed is 11 - 4 = 7.
                 Since it takes 8 hours to install each window, and there are 7 windows left to be installed, the total time required to install the rest of the windows is 7 x 8 = 56 hours.
                 Therefore, it will take the builder 56 hours to install the rest of the windows.
                 Alternatively, we can also calculate the time required to install the rest of the windows by subtracting the time already spent from the total time required to install all the windows. The total time required to install all the windows is 11 x 8 = 88 hours. The time already spent is 4 x 8 = 32 hours.
                 So, the time required to install the rest of the windows is 88 - 32 = 56 hours.
                 Therefore, it will take the builder 56 hours to install the rest of the windows.

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Rachel had, we need to calculate the number of scarves and mittens separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of scarves. There were 7 boxes, and each box had 3 scarves. So, the total number of scarves is 7 x 3 = 21.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of mittens. There were 7 boxes, and each box had 4 mittens. So, the total number of mittens is 7 x 4 = 28.
                 To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we need to add the number of scarves and mittens together. So, the total number of pieces of winter clothing is 21 + 28 = 49.

To find the number of pictures in each album, we need to divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.
                 Total number of pictures = 5 (from phone) + 35 (from camera) = 40
                 Number of albums = 8
                 Number of pictures in each album = Total number of pictures / Number of albums = 40 / 8 = 5
                 Therefore, there are 5 pictures in each of the 8 albums.<|eot_id|>

To find out how long it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes, we need to first determine how many potatoes are left to cook. Since the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes out of 9, he has 9 - 7 = 2 potatoes left to cook.
                 Since each potato takes 3 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes left by the cooking time per potato to find the total cooking time.
                 2 potatoes * 3 minutes/potato = 6 minutes
                 Therefore, it will take the chef 6 minutes to cook the remaining 2 potatoes.<|eot_id|>

Chloe baked 7 brownies, but needed 16 total for her party. To find out how much flour she still needs, we need to find out how much flour she used in total and then subtract that from the total amount of flour she needs. Since she used 6 cups of flour on each brownie and she baked 7 brownies, she used a total of 7 x 6 = 42 cups of flour. To find out how much flour she still needs, we need to subtract 42 from the total amount of flour she needs, which is 16. 16 - 42 = -26. Since we can't have a negative amount of flour, we know that Chloe baked too many brownies. To find out how many brownies she baked too many of, we need to subtract the number of brownies she baked from the total number of brownies she needed. 16 - 7 = 9. Chloe baked 9 brownies too many. To find out how many cups of flour she still needs, we need to multiply the number of brownies she baked too many by the amount of flour she used on each brownie. 9 x 6 = 54. Chloe still needs 54 cups of flour.

                 8 (total tickets) ÷ 4 (tickets per piece of candy) = 2

To find out how long the money will last Jerry, we need to first find out how much money he has in total. He made 14 dollars mowing lawns and 31 dollars weed eating, so he has a total of 14 + 31 = 45 dollars.
                 Since Jerry only spends 5 dollars a week, we can divide the total amount of money he has (45 dollars) by the amount he spends per week (5 dollars) to find out how many weeks the money will last.
                 45 ÷ 5 = 9 weeks.
                 Therefore, the money will last Jerry 9 weeks.<|eot_id|>

We also know that she planted 4 seeds in each small garden. To find out how many small gardens she had, we need to divide the number of seeds she planted in the small gardens by the number of seeds she planted in each small garden.
                 First, we need to find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens. We know that she started with 52 seeds and planted 28 seeds in the big garden. To find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens, we need to subtract 28 from 52.

To find out how many socks John would have, we need to subtract the number of old socks he threw away from the total number of socks he had, and then add the number of new socks he bought.
                 33 (initial socks) - 19 (old socks thrown away) = 14
                 14 (remaining socks) + 13 (new socks bought) = 27
                 Therefore, John would have 27 socks.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many boxes Luke had to use, we need to divide the number of games he had left by the number of games he put in each box. He started with 57 games and sold 39, so he had 57 - 39 = 18 games left. Since he put 2 games in each box, we divide 18 by 2. 18 ÷ 2 = 9. Therefore, Luke had to use 9 boxes to pack the rest of his games. The answer is 9.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many small gardens Emily had, we need to first find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens. We know that she planted 36 seeds in the big garden. We also know that she planted 2 seeds in each small garden. To find out how many seeds she planted in the small gardens, we need to subtract the seeds planted in the big garden from the total number of seeds.
                 42 total seeds - 36 seeds in the big garden = 6 seeds in the small gardens.
                 Since she planted 2 seeds in each small garden, we can divide the total number of seeds planted in the small gardens by 2 to find out how many small gardens she had.
                 6 seeds in the small gardens / 2 seeds per small garden = 3 small gardens.

To determine how many loads Sarah would have to do, we need to calculate the total number of items she needs to wash. She has 43 shirts and 2 sweaters, so the total number of items is 43 + 2 = 45.
                 Since the washing machine can only wash 5 items at a time, we need to divide the total number of items by 5 to find out how many loads she needs to do.
                 45 ÷ 5 = 9
                 Therefore, Sarah would have to do 9 loads to wash all of her shirts and sweaters.
                 Alternatively, we can also calculate the number of loads by dividing the number of shirts by 5 and rounding up to the nearest whole number.
                 43 ÷ 5 = 8.6
                 Since we can't do a fraction of a load, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

To find out how much money Oliver has now, we need to add the money he got for his birthday (50 dollars) to the money he already had (35 dollars). This gives us a total of 35 + 50 = 85 dollars. Then, we need to subtract the money he spent on the new game (84 dollars) from the total. This gives us 85 - 84 = 1 dollar. Therefore, Oliver now has 1 dollar.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of books Megan had, we need to calculate the number of books on the mystery shelves and the number of books on the picture shelves, and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of books on the mystery shelves. Megan had 8 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf had exactly 7 books. To find the total number of books on the mystery shelves, we multiply the number of shelves (8) by the number of books per shelf (7).
                 8 x 7 = 56
                 Next, let's calculate the number of books on the picture shelves. Megan had 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf had exactly 7 books. To find the total number of books on the picture shelves, we multiply the number of shelves (2) by the number of books per shelf (7).
                 2 x 7 = 14
                 Finally, we add the total number of books on the mystery shelves (56) and the total number of books on the picture shelves (14) to find the total number of books Megan had.
                 56 + 14 = 70
                 Therefore, Megan had a total of 70 books.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money the waiter earned, we need to first find out how many customers left a tip. Since there were 9 customers in total and 5 of them didn't leave a tip, the number of customers who left a tip is 9 - 5 = 4.
                 Since each of the 4 customers who left a tip gave the waiter $8, the total amount of money the waiter earned is 4 x $8 = $32.
                 Therefore, the waiter earned $32.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many points Gwen and her friends earned, we need to calculate the total pounds of paper they recycled. Gwen recycled 5 pounds and her friends recycled 13 pounds, so the total pounds of paper they recycled is 5 + 13 = 18 pounds. Since they earn one point for every 3 pounds of paper they recycle, we need to divide the total pounds of paper by 3 to find out how many points they earned. 18 ÷ 3 = 6. Therefore, Gwen and her friends earned 6 points.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many songs Robin has on her mp3 player, we need to subtract the number of old songs she deleted (8) from the total number of songs she originally had (30), and then add the number of new songs she added (10).
                 First, we subtract 8 from 30: 30 - 8 = 22.
                 Then, we add 10 to 22: 22 + 10 = 32.
                 Therefore, after deleting 8 old songs and adding 10 new songs, Robin has 32 songs on her mp3 player.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take the chef to cook the rest of the potatoes, we first need to find out how many potatoes are left to cook. Since the chef has already cooked 7 potatoes out of 16, the number of potatoes left to cook is 16 - 7 = 9.
                 Since each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, the total time it will take to cook the remaining 9 potatoes is 9 x 5 = 45 minutes.
                 Therefore, it will take the chef 45 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.<|eot_id|>

                 First, we multiply the number of times he rode the ferris wheel (7) by the number of times he rode the bumper cars (3).
                 7 x 3 = 21
                 Then, we multiply 21 by the cost of each ride (5).
                 21 x 5 = 105
                 Therefore, Billy used 105 tickets.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it would take for all of the puppies to be adopted, we need to calculate the total number of puppies and then divide that number by the number of puppies adopted per day.
                 The total number of puppies is 5 (initial puppies) + 35 (additional puppies) = 40 puppies.
                 The number of puppies adopted per day is 8.
                 To find the number of days it would take to adopt all the puppies, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day: 40 puppies / 8 puppies per day = 5 days.
                 Therefore, it would take 5 days for all of the puppies to be adopted.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to calculate the total number of parrots and parakeets separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the total number of parrots. There are 4 cages with 8 parrots in each cage, so the total number of parrots is 4 x 8 = 32.
                 Next, let's calculate the total number of parakeets. There are 4 cages with 2 parakeets in each cage, so the total number of parakeets is 4 x 2 = 8.
                 Finally, we add the total number of parrots and parakeets together to find the total number of birds in the pet store. 32 (parrots) + 8 (parakeets) = 40.
                 Therefore, the pet store has a total of 40 birds.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Will still has, we need to subtract the number of boxes he gave away (3) from the total number of boxes he bought (7).
                 7 (total boxes) - 3 (boxes given away) = 4
                 Since each box contains 4 pieces of candy, we multiply the number of boxes Will still has (4) by the number of pieces in each box (4).
                 4 (boxes) * 4 (pieces per box) = 16
                 Therefore, Will still has 16 pieces of chocolate candy.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of coins Luke had, we need to calculate the number of coins in the piles of quarters and the number of coins in the piles of dimes. Since each pile has 3 coins and there are 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes, we can multiply the number of piles by the number of coins in each pile.
                 For the quarters: 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 quarters
                 For the dimes: 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 dimes
                 To find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and the number of dimes: 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins
                 Therefore, Luke had a total of 30 coins.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many shelves Jerry will need, we need to divide the number of books he has left by the number of books that can fit on a shelf.
                 Jerry has 34 - 7 = 27 books left.
                 27 ÷ 3 = 9
                 Therefore, Jerry will need 9 shelves to put away the remaining books.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of books Gwen had, we need to calculate the number of books on the mystery shelves and the number of books on the picture shelves, and then add them together.
                 First, we calculate the number of books on the mystery shelves: 3 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 27 books.
                 Next, we calculate the number of books on the picture shelves: 5 shelves * 9 books/shelf = 45 books.
                 Finally, we add the number of books on the mystery shelves and the number of books on the picture shelves: 27 books + 45 books = 72 books.

To determine the number of tables needed, first calculate the number of people who actually attended the luncheon by subtracting the number of people who didn't show up from the total number of people invited.
                 18 (total invited) - 12 (did not show up) = 6 (attended)
                 Since each table can hold 3 people, divide the number of people who attended by the number of people each table can hold to find the number of tables needed.
                 6 (attended) ÷ 3 (people per table) = 2

                 Total number of students = 26 boys + 46 girls = 72 students
                 Number of students in each group = 9
                 Total number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group
                 Total number of groups = 72 / 9
                 Total number of groups = 8
                 Therefore, the schools debate team can make 8 groups with 9 students in each group.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many bad carrots Faye and her mom had, we need to subtract the number of good carrots from the total number of carrots they picked.
                 First, we add the number of carrots Faye picked (23) to the number of carrots her mom picked (5).
                 23 + 5 = 28
                 Then, we subtract the number of good carrots (12) from the total number of carrots (28).

To determine the number of tables the waiter had, we first need to find out how many customers were left after 12 of them left.
                 44 (initial customers) - 12 (customers who left) = 32
                 Since each table had 8 people, we can divide the remaining customers by 8 to find the number of tables.
                 32 (remaining customers) ÷ 8 (customers per table) = 4

To find out how many points you would earn, first determine how many enemies you defeated. Since you destroyed all but 6 of the 8 enemies, you defeated 8 - 6 = 2 enemies. Since each enemy defeated gives you 5 points, you would earn 2 x 5 = 10 points. Therefore, you would earn 10 points for defeating all but 6 of the enemies in the level.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long the money will last John, we need to calculate the total amount of money he has. He made 6 dollars mowing lawns and 18 dollars weed eating, so the total amount of money he has is 6 + 18 = 24 dollars.
                 Since John only spends 3 dollars a week, we can divide the total amount of money he has (24 dollars) by the amount he spends per week (3 dollars) to find out how many weeks the money will last.
                 24 dollars / 3 dollars per week = 8 weeks.

To find the total number of books Bianca had, we need to calculate the number of books on the mystery shelves and the number of books on the picture shelves, then add them together.
                 Mystery shelves: 5 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 40 books
                 Picture shelves: 4 shelves * 8 books per shelf = 32 books
                 Total number of books: 40 books + 32 books = 72 books

To find out how much money the waiter earned, we need to first find out how many customers left a tip. We can do this by subtracting the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.
                 7 (total customers) - 4 (customers who didn't leave a tip) = 3 (customers who left a tip)
                 Since each customer who left a tip gave the waiter $9, we can multiply the number of customers who left a tip by the amount of money they gave.
                 3 (customers who left a tip) * $9 = $27

To determine how much flour Zoe still needs, we need to calculate the total amount of flour required for 11 brownies and subtract the amount she already used.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of flour needed for 11 brownies. Since each brownie requires 7 cups of flour, we multiply the number of brownies by the amount of flour per brownie:
                 11 brownies * 7 cups/brownie = 77 cups
                 Next, we subtract the amount of flour Zoe already used (5 brownies * 7 cups/brownie = 35 cups) from the total amount needed:
                 77 cups - 35 cups = 42 cups
                 Therefore, Zoe still needs 42 cups of flour for her party.<|eot_id|>

                 Since the painter has already spent 5 x 8 = 40 hours to paint the first 5 rooms, the remaining time required to paint the rest of the rooms is 72 - 40 = 32 hours.

To find out how many towels Maria ended up with, we need to subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother (34) from the total number of towels she bought (35 + 21).
                 First, let's calculate the total number of towels she bought: 35 + 21 = 56.
                 Now, let's subtract the number of towels she gave to her mother: 56 - 34 = 22.
                 Therefore, Maria ended up with 22 towels.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing Paige had, we need to calculate the number of scarves and mittens separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of scarves. There were 6 boxes, and each box had 5 scarves. So, the total number of scarves is 6 x 5 = 30.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of mittens. Again, there were 6 boxes, and each box had 5 mittens. So, the total number of mittens is also 6 x 5 = 30.
                 To find the total number of pieces of winter clothing, we add the number of scarves and mittens together: 30 + 30 = 60.

To find out how many loads Wendy would have to do, we need to divide the total number of shirts and sweaters by the number of pieces of clothing that the washing machine can wash at a time.
                 Total number of shirts and sweaters = 39 + 33 = 72
                 Since the washing machine can only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time, we will divide 72 by 8.
                 72 ÷ 8 = 9
                 Therefore, Wendy would have to do 9 loads to wash all of her shirts and sweaters.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many 7 dollar toys Roger could buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the cost of the new game from the total amount of money he had.
                 68 - 47 = 21
                 Since each toy costs 7 dollars, we can divide 21 by 7 to find out how many toys he could buy.
                 21 ÷ 7 = 3
                 Therefore, Roger could buy 3 7 dollar toys with the money he had left.<|eot_id|>

                 56 (total pictures) - 33 (colored pictures) = 23
                 Debby still has 23 pictures to color.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we first need to find out how many rooms are left to paint. Since the painter has already painted 4 rooms out of 12, the number of rooms left to paint is 12 - 4 = 8.
                 Since each room takes 3 hours to paint, the total time it will take to paint the remaining 8 rooms is 8 * 3 = 24 hours.

To determine how much money John would need to finish his collection, we need to calculate the difference between the number of action figures he needs and the number he already has.
                 The difference is 7 - 5 = 2.
                 Since each action figure costs $5, we multiply the difference by the cost of each action figure.
                 2 x $5 = $10.
                 Therefore, John would need $10 to finish his collection.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the cost for the group to eat, first determine the number of adults. Since there are 15 people in total and 9 are kids, the number of adults is 15 - 9 = 6. Since each adult meal costs $2, the total cost for the adults is 6 x $2 = $12. Since kids eat free, there is no additional cost for the kids. Therefore, the total cost for the group to eat is $12.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of lives the remaining players had, we need to multiply the number of remaining players by the number of lives each player had. There were 10 players initially, and 7 quit, so 10 - 7 = 3 players remained. Each of the 3 remaining players had 8 lives, so the total number of lives is 3 x 8 = 24. The answer is 24.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many tables the company needs, we need to divide the number of people who showed up by the number of people each table can hold.
                 Number of people who showed up = 45 - 35 = 10
                 Number of people each table can hold = 2
                 Number of tables needed = Number of people who showed up / Number of people each table can hold
                 Number of tables needed = 10 / 2
                 Number of tables needed = 5

To find out how much money Zoe would have made, we need to first find out how many chocolate bars she sold. Since there were 13 bars in the box and she sold all but 6, she must have sold 13 - 6 = 7 bars. Since each bar costs $6, we can multiply the number of bars she sold by the cost of each bar to find the total amount of money she made. 7 x $6 = $42. Therefore, Zoe would have made $42.
Note: The response should be in the same format as the instruction. ### Instruction:
                 Each chocolate bar in a box cost $8. If a box had 15 bars total and Zoe sold all but 3 bars, how much money would she have made?

To find out how many 2 dollar games Edward could buy with the money he had left, we need to subtract the cost of the new mower blades from the total amount of money he made.
                 37 (total money made) - 21 (cost of new mower blades) = 16
                 Since each game costs 2 dollars, we can divide 16 by 2 to find out how many games he could buy.
                 16 ÷ 2 = 8
