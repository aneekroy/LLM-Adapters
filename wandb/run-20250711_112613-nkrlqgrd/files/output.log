To find out how many hours Tom paid to have the bike checked out, we need to subtract 17 dollars from the total amount he paid, which is 80 dollars. This will give us the amount he paid for the hourly rate.
                 80 - 17 = 63
                 Since the hourly rate is 7 dollars, we can divide 63 by 7 to find the number of hours.
                 63 ÷ 7 = 9
                 Therefore, Tom paid 9 hours to have the bike checked out.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of loaves served, we need to add the number of loaves of wheat bread and the number of loaves of white bread. The number of loaves of wheat bread is 0.2, and the number of loaves of white bread is 0.4. Adding these two numbers together, we get 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6. Therefore, the restaurant served a total of 0.6 loaves of bread. Since a standard loaf of bread is 1, the restaurant served a total of 0.6 loaves of bread, which is equivalent to 6/10 or 3/5 of a loaf of bread. The restaurant served a total of 0.6 loaves of bread, which is equivalent to 6/10 or 3/5 of a loaf of bread. The restaurant served a total of 0.6 loaves of bread, which is equivalent to 6/10 or 3/5 of a loaf of bread.

To determine how many years it will take for the tree to be 29 feet, we need to subtract the initial height of the tree (4 feet) from the desired height (29 feet). This gives us 29 - 4 = 25 feet. Since the tree grows at a rate of 5 feet per year, we can divide the remaining height (25 feet) by the growth rate (5 feet per year). This gives us 25 ÷ 5 = 5 years. Therefore, it will take 5 years for the tree to be 29 feet.<|eot_id|>

To find the smallest of the three consecutive even numbers, let's denote the smallest number as x. Since the numbers are consecutive even numbers, the next two numbers can be represented as x + 2 and x + 4. The sum of these three numbers is given as 162, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 162. Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 6 = 162. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we have 3x = 156. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 52. Therefore, the smallest of the three consecutive even numbers is 52.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many markers are in each package, we need to divide the total number of markers (40) by the number of packages (7).

                 Since we can't divide markers into fractions, we can round down to 5 markers per package. However, this leaves 5 markers unaccounted for (40 - 35 = 5). To distribute the remaining markers evenly, we can put 1 extra marker in each of 5 packages.
                 Therefore, there are 6 markers in each of 5 packages and 5 markers in each of the remaining 2 packages.

To find out how much change Fred received, we need to calculate the total cost of the movie tickets and the borrowed movie. The total cost is $5.92 + $6.79 = $12.71. Fred paid with a $20 bill, so we need to subtract the total cost from $20 to find the change. $20 - $12.71 = $7.29. Therefore, Fred received $7.29 in change.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much change Sandy received, we need to calculate the total cost of the football and the baseball. The football costs $9.14, and the baseball costs $20 - $6.81 = $13.19. The total cost is $9.14 + $13.19 = $22.33. Sandy paid with a $20 bill, so the change she received is $20 - $22.33 = -$2.33. Since Sandy can't receive a negative amount of change, this means that she didn't have enough money to pay for both the football and the baseball with a $20 bill. She would have to pay for one of the items with the $20 bill and then pay for the other item separately. The change she received is -$2.33, which means that she would have to pay an additional $2.33 for the other item.
                Alternatively, we can calculate the change by subtracting the total cost from the $20 bill. The change is $20 - $22.33 = -$2.33. Since Sandy can't receive a negative amount of change, this means that she didn't have enough money to pay for both the football and the baseball with a $20 bill. She would

To find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time, we need to multiply the number of seats by the number of people each seat can hold.
                 Number of seats = 14
                 Number of people per seat = 6
                 Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel = Number of seats * Number of people per seat
                 Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel = 14 * 6
                 Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel = 84
                 Therefore, 84 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many students were in each bus, we need to divide the total number of students (375) by the number of buses (7).
                 375 ÷ 7 = 53.57
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number.
                 53.57 ≈ 53
                 Therefore, there were approximately 53 students in each bus.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation. Let's represent the unknown number as "x". The problem states that 0.20 of the number decreased by 4 is equal to 6. We can write this as an equation: 0.20x - 4 = 6. To solve for x, we need to isolate the variable. First, we add 4 to both sides of the equation: 0.20x = 6 + 4. This simplifies to 0.20x = 10. Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.20 to solve for x: x = 10 / 0.20. This simplifies to x = 50. Therefore, the number we are looking for is 50.<|eot_id|>

To find the difference in weight between the piece of iron and the piece of aluminum, we need to subtract the weight of the aluminum from the weight of the iron.
                 Weight of iron = 11.166666666666666 pounds
                 Weight of aluminum = 0.8333333333333334 pounds
                 Difference in weight = Weight of iron - Weight of aluminum
                 Difference in weight = 11.166666666666666 - 0.8333333333333334
                 Difference in weight = 10.333333333333334 pounds
                 Therefore, the piece of iron weighed 10.333333333333334 pounds more than the piece of aluminum.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of houses built during the housing boom, we need to subtract the number of houses before the boom from the number of houses after the boom.
                 Number of houses before the boom = 1,426

To find out how many stickers Mika has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers she has and then subtract the number of stickers she gave to her sister and used for the greeting card.
                 Mika initially had 20 stickers. She bought 26 stickers, so now she has 20 + 26 = 46 stickers. Then she got 20 stickers for her birthday, so now she has 46 + 20 = 66 stickers.
                 After giving 6 stickers to her sister, Mika has 66 - 6 = 60 stickers. Finally, she used 58 stickers for the greeting card, so now she has 60 - 58 = 2 stickers left.

To determine the number of birds Sally saw, we need to multiply the number of dozens by the number of birds in a dozen. Since there are 12 birds in a dozen, we can calculate the total number of birds as follows:
                 1 dozen x 12 birds/dozen = 12 birds
                 Therefore, Sally saw 12 birds in the tree.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many cards Benny started with, we need to figure out how many cards he had before his dog ate half of his collection. We know that after his dog ate half of his collection, he had 34 cards left. Since his dog ate half of his collection, Benny must have had twice as many cards as he has left. So, we can multiply 34 by 2 to find out how many cards Benny had before his dog ate half of his collection. 34 x 2 = 68. Therefore, Benny started with 68 cards.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of calories in 42 candy bars, we need to multiply the number of calories in one candy bar by the total number of candy bars. Since there are 4 dozen calories in a candy bar, we first need to convert the number of calories in one candy bar to a numerical value. One dozen is equal to 12, so 4 dozen is equal to 4 x 12 = 48. Therefore, there are 48 calories in one candy bar. To find the total number of calories in 42 candy bars, we multiply the number of calories in one candy bar (48) by the total number of candy bars (42). 48 x 42 = 2016. Therefore, there are 2016 calories in 42 candy bars. The answer is 2016.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much water is left in the bucket, we need to subtract the amount of water that was poured out from the amount of water that was initially in the bucket.
                 Initial amount of water = 0.8 gallons
                 Amount of water poured out = 0.2 gallons
                 Amount of water left = Initial amount of water - Amount of water poured out
                 Amount of water left = 0.8 - 0.2
                 Amount of water left = 0.6 gallons
                 Therefore, there are 0.6 gallons of water left in the bucket.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many minutes Milan was billed for, we need to subtract the monthly fee from the total bill. Subtracting the monthly fee of 2 dollars from the total bill of 23.36 dollars gives us 23.36 - 2 = 21.36 dollars. Since Milan is billed 12 cents per minute, we need to divide 21.36 by 0.12 to find the number of minutes. 21.36 ÷ 0.12 = 179 minutes. Therefore, Milan was billed for 179 minutes.<|eot_id|>

The polar bear eats 0.2 of a bucket of trout and 0.4 of a bucket of salmon each day. To find the total number of buckets of fish the polar bear eats daily, we need to add the number of buckets of trout and the number of buckets of salmon.
                 0.2 (buckets of trout) + 0.4 (buckets of salmon) = 0.6 (buckets of fish)

To determine how much Benny will have to pay, we need to calculate the total cost of the lunch special for all three people. Since each person orders the lunch special for $8, we can multiply the cost per person by the number of people.

                 Total cost = $8 x 3
                 Total cost = $24
                 Since Benny agreed to pay the bill, he will have to pay the total cost of $24.

To find the number of unbroken seashells Tom found, we need to subtract the number of broken seashells from the total number of seashells.
                 Total number of seashells = 7
                 Number of broken seashells = 4
                 Number of unbroken seashells = Total number of seashells - Number of broken seashells
                 Number of unbroken seashells = 7 - 4
                 Number of unbroken seashells = 3
                 Therefore, Tom found 3 unbroken seashells.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of books John reads in 6 weeks, we need to calculate the number of days he reads and multiply it by the number of books he reads per day.
                 Since John reads every Monday and Tuesday, he reads 2 days a week. In 6 weeks, he will read 2 days/week * 6 weeks = 12 days.
                 Since John reads 4 books a day, he will read 4 books/day * 12 days = 48 books in 6 weeks.
                 Therefore, John will read 48 books in 6 weeks.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Chris had before his birthday, we need to subtract the total amount of money he received from his relatives from the total amount of money he has now.
                 The total amount of money Chris received from his relatives is $25 (from his grandmother) + $20 (from his aunt and uncle) + $75 (from his parents) = $120.
                 To find the amount of money Chris had before his birthday, we subtract $120 from the total amount of money he has now, which is $279.
                 $279 - $120 = $159.

To find Alyssa's weekly allowance, we first need to determine how much money she had before washing the family car. Since she ended with 12 dollars and she earned 8 dollars from washing the car, we can subtract 8 dollars from 12 dollars to find out how much money she had before washing the car.
                 12 dollars - 8 dollars = 4 dollars
                 Since Alyssa spent half of her allowance going to the movies, the 4 dollars she had before washing the car is half of her weekly allowance. To find her weekly allowance, we need to multiply 4 dollars by 2.

To find out how many tons of grain the ship originally contained, we need to add the amount of grain that spilled into the water (49,952 tons) to the amount of grain that remained onboard (918 tons). This will give us the total amount of grain the ship originally had.
                 Let's do the math:
                 Original grain = Grain spilled + Grain remaining
                 Original grain = 49,952 tons + 918 tons
                 Original grain = 50,870 tons
                 Therefore, the ship originally contained 50,870 tons of grain.<|eot_id|>

To find the cost of each book, we need to subtract the amount of money Sam had after buying the books from the amount of money he had before buying the books. This will give us the total cost of the books.
                 Total cost of the books = Initial amount of money - Final amount of money
                 Total cost of the books = 79 - 16
                 Total cost of the books = 63
                 Now that we know the total cost of the books, we can find the cost of each book by dividing the total cost by the number of books.
                 Cost of each book = Total cost of the books / Number of books
                 Cost of each book = 63 / 9
                 Cost of each book = 7

To find the fraction of the nails that are either size 2d or 4d, we need to add the fractions of size 2d nails and size 4d nails. The fraction of size 2d nails is 0.25, and the fraction of size 4d nails is 0.5. To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 5 is 10. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 10: 0.25 = 2/10 and 0.5 = 5/10. Now we can add the fractions: 2/10 + 5/10 = 7/10. Therefore, 7/10 of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of people who went on the field trip, we need to calculate the number of people in the vans and the number of people in the buses separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of people in the vans. There were 6 vans, and each van had 6 people. So, the total number of people in the vans is 6 x 6 = 36.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of people in the buses. There were 8 buses, and each bus had 18 people. So, the total number of people in the buses is 8 x 18 = 144.
                 To find the total number of people who went on the field trip, we need to add the number of people in the vans and the number of people in the buses. So, the total number of people is 36 + 144 = 180.

To find out how many stickers Luke has left, we need to calculate the total number of stickers he has and then subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used.
                 First, let's calculate the total number of stickers Luke has. He initially had 20 stickers, bought 12 more, and got 20 for his birthday. So, the total number of stickers he has is 20 + 12 + 20 = 52.
                 Next, let's subtract the number of stickers Luke gave away and used. He gave 5 stickers to his sister and used 8 stickers to decorate a greeting card. So, the total number of stickers he gave away and used is 5 + 8 = 13.
                 Now, let's subtract the number of stickers he gave away and used from the total number of stickers he has. 52 - 13 = 39.

                 For Wednesday, 4 half-dollars is equal to 4 x $0.50 = $2.00.
                 For Thursday, 14 half-dollars is equal to 14 x $0.50 = $7.00.
                 Now, we can add the two amounts together: $2.00 + $7.00 = $9.00.

To find out how many comic books Sandy began with, we need to work backwards from the information given. We know that after selling half of her comic books, she bought 6 more and ended up with 13. This means that before buying 6 more, she had 13 - 6 = 7 comic books. Since she sold half of her comic books before buying 6 more, this means that she had 7 * 2 = 14 comic books before selling half of them. Therefore, Sandy began with 14 comic books.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of baseball games Fred missed, we need to subtract the number of games he attended from the total number of games played.
                 Total number of games played = 616
                 Number of games attended = 147
                 Number of games missed = Total number of games played - Number of games attended
                 Number of games missed = 616 - 147
                 Number of games missed = 469
                 Therefore, Fred missed 469 baseball games this year.<|eot_id|>

To find the total amount of money Sam spent, we need to add the amount he spent on ice cream and the amount he spent on baseball cards. The amount he spent on ice cream is 2 pennies, which is equal to 2 cents. The amount he spent on baseball cards is 12 dimes, which is equal to 12 x 10 cents, or 120 cents. Adding these two amounts together, we get 2 cents + 120 cents = 122 cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert 122 cents to dollars by dividing by 100. 122 cents ÷ 100 = 1.22 dollars. Therefore, Sam spent a total of 1.22 dollars on ice cream and baseball cards.<|eot_id|>

To find the fraction of the apartments that are either one- or two-bedroom apartments, we need to add the fraction of one-bedroom apartments to the fraction of two-bedroom apartments.

To find out how much more the chemistry textbook weighs than the geometry textbook, we need to subtract the weight of the geometry textbook from the weight of the chemistry textbook. The chemistry textbook weighs 7.125 pounds and the geometry textbook weighs 0.625 pounds. Subtracting the weight of the geometry textbook from the weight of the chemistry textbook gives us 7.125 - 0.625 = 6.5 pounds.

To find the smallest of the three consecutive odd numbers, let's denote the smallest number as x. Since the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, the next two numbers can be represented as x + 2 and x + 4. The sum of these three numbers is given as 69, so we can write the equation: x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 69. Combining like terms, we get 3x + 6 = 69. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we have 3x = 63. Dividing both sides by 3, we find x = 21. Therefore, the smallest of the three consecutive odd numbers is 21.<|eot_id|>

Since 0.7 of the students received A's and 0.2 received B's, the fraction of students who received either A's or B's is 0.7 + 0.2 = 0.9. Therefore, 0.9 or 90% of the students received either A's or B's.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of packs of baseball cards Nancy, Melanie, Mary, and Alyssa have, we need to multiply the number of baseball cards each of them bought by the number of cards in a pack. Since each of them bought 540 baseball cards and each pack contains 20 cards, we can multiply 540 by 20.
                 540 * 20 = 10,800
                 Therefore, Nancy, Melanie, Mary, and Alyssa have a total of 10,800 packs of baseball cards.
                 Alternatively, we can multiply the number of people by the number of packs each person bought. Since there are 4 people and each bought 540 packs, we can multiply 4 by 540.
                 4 * 540 = 2,160

To find the total amount of money Joan found, we need to add the number of dimes she found in her jacket to the number of dimes she found in her shorts.
                 15 dimes in her jacket + 4 dimes in her shorts = 19 dimes
                 Since each dime is worth $0.10, we can multiply the total number of dimes by the value of each dime to find the total amount of money.
                 19 dimes * $0.10 = $1.90

To find the value of the vehicle last year, we need to divide the value of the vehicle this year by 0.8.

                 Value of the vehicle last year = 16,000 / 0.8
                 Value of the vehicle last year = 20,000
                 Therefore, the value of the vehicle last year is 20,000 dollars.
                 Alternatively, we can multiply the value of the vehicle this year by 1/0.8 to find the value of the vehicle last year.
                 Value of the vehicle last year = Value of the vehicle this year * (1/0.8)
                 Value of the vehicle last year = 16,000 * (1/0.8)

To find the total amount of money Sara spent on movies, we need to add the cost of the 2 movie tickets, the cost of the rented movie, and the cost of the bought movie.
                 The cost of the 2 movie tickets is 2 x $10.62 = $21.24.
                 The cost of the rented movie is $1.59.

                 The toothfairy left Joan 14 half-dollars. Since each half-dollar is worth $0.50, the total value of the half-dollars is 14 x $0.50 = $7.00.
                 The toothfairy left Joan 14 dimes. Since each dime is worth $0.10, the total value of the dimes is 14 x $0.10 = $1.40.
                 To find the total amount of money the toothfairy left Joan, we need to add the values of the quarters, half-dollars, and dimes together: $3.50 + $7.00 + $1.40 = $11.90.

To find out how much more Seth spent on ice cream than on yogurt, we need to calculate the total amount spent on ice cream and the total amount spent on yogurt, and then subtract the amount spent on yogurt from the amount spent on ice cream.
                 First, we calculate the total amount spent on ice cream: 20 cartons * $6 per carton = $120.
                 Next, we calculate the total amount spent on yogurt: 2 cartons * $1 per carton = $2.
                 Finally, we subtract the amount spent on yogurt from the amount spent on ice cream: $120 - $2 = $118.

To find out how much money Paula has left, we need to subtract the total cost of the clothes she bought from the amount of money her aunt gave her.
First, we need to find the total cost of the clothes she bought. She bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each, so the total cost of the shirts is 2 x $11 = $22. She also bought a pair of pants that cost $13. So, the total cost of the clothes she bought is $22 + $13 = $35.
Next, we need to subtract the total cost of the clothes she bought from the amount of money her aunt gave her. Paula's aunt gave her $109, and the total cost of the clothes she bought is $35. So, Paula has $109 - $35 = $74 left to buy more clothes.

To find the total number of cakes served today, we need to add the number of cakes served during lunch and the number of cakes served during dinner.
                 Number of cakes served during lunch = 6
                 Number of cakes served during dinner = 9
                 Total number of cakes served today = 6 + 9
                 Total number of cakes served today = 15
                 Therefore, 15 cakes were served today.<|eot_id|>
