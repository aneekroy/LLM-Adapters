To find the difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth, we need to first find the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to the actual property worth that is divisible by 100.
                 The actual property worth is $1023.65. The greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 that is divisible by 100 is $1020.
                 To find the difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth, we subtract the recorded property worth from the actual property worth: $1023.65 - $1020 = $3.65.
                 Therefore, the difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth is $3.65. The correct answer is (D) 2.65. I made a mistake in my calculation. The greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 that is divisible by 100 is actually $1020, and the difference between the actual property worth and the recorded property worth is $1023.65 - $1020 = $3.65. The greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 that is divisible by 100 is $1020, and the difference between the actual property worth

To find the perimeter of the rectangular piece, we first need to determine the length and breadth. Let's denote the breadth as 'b'. According to the problem, the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth, so the length can be expressed as 4b + 1. The area of the rectangle is given as 150 sq m, which is equal to the product of the length and breadth. Therefore, we can set up the equation 4b * (4b + 1) = 150. Solving for 'b', we get 16b^2 + 4b = 150, which simplifies to 16b^2 + 4b - 150 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get (4b - 15)(4b + 10) = 0. This gives us two possible values for 'b': b = 15/4 or b = -10/4. Since the breadth cannot be negative, we take b = 15/4 = 3.75 m. Now that we have the breadth, we can find the length: length = 4b + 1 = 4 * 3.75 + 1 = 15

Let's assume the total number of children in the row is x. Neha is 12th from the left end and Radha is 6th from the right end. So, Neha's position from the right end is x - 12 + 1 = x - 11 and Radha's position from the left end is x - 6 + 1 = x - 5. When Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, Radha's new position from the left end is x - 5 - 2 = x - 7 and Neha's new position from the right end is x - 11 + 2 = x - 9. There are 6 children between Radha and Neha. So, the difference between Neha's new position from the right end and Radha's new position from the left end is 6. Therefore, we can set up the equation (x - 9) - (x - 7) = 6. Solving for x, we get x - 9 - x + 7 = 6, which simplifies to -2 = 6. This is a contradiction, so our assumption

To find the percentage by which the shopkeeper must increase the price to the original, we need to calculate the difference between the original price and the discounted price, and then divide that difference by the original price.
                 Let's assume the original price of an item is $100. After a 20% discount, the price becomes $80.
                 The difference between the original price and the discounted price is $100 - $80 = $20.
                 To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference ($20) by the original price ($100), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.
                 ($20 / $100) * 100 = 20%
                 Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 20% to return to the original price. The correct answer is (B) 20%.<|eot_id|>

To find the new length of the ribbon after it was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3, we need to divide the original length by the sum of the parts of the ratio (5 + 3 = 8) and then multiply the result by the part of the ratio that represents the new length (3).
                 First, we divide the original length (30 cm) by the sum of the parts of the ratio (8): 30 cm / 8 = 3.75 cm.
                 Then, we multiply the result by the part of the ratio that represents the new length (3): 3.75 cm * 3 = 11.25 cm.
                 Therefore, the new length of the ribbon is 11.25 cm, which is closest to answer choice (E) 12.<|eot_id|>

To determine how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we first need to convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.
                 Next, we need to calculate Bill's speed on a windy day. His normal speed is 15 mph, and his speed is reduced by 4 mph on a windy day. Therefore, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.
                 Now that we know Bill's speed on a windy day, we can calculate the distance he can travel in 0.35 hours. The formula for distance is d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (or speed), and t is the time. Plugging in the values, we get d = 11 * 0.35 = 3.85 miles.
                 Therefore, Bill can travel approximately 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes. The correct answer is (D) 3.85 miles.<|eot_id|>

To find the diameter of the sphere that circumscribes the rectangular solid, we can use the fact that the diagonal of the rectangular solid is equal to the diameter of the sphere. The diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the three-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the length of the diagonal is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the three sides. In this case, we have a rectangular solid with sides of length 3, 4, and 15, so the square of the length of the diagonal is 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 = 250. Taking the square root of both sides gives us the length of the diagonal, which is sqrt(250) = 15.8113. Since the diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid, the diameter of the sphere is also 15.8113. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 15.8113.<|eot_id|>

To find the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Since the two ants are standing side-by-side, we can assume that the angle of elevation of the sun is the same for both ants. This means that the ratio of the height of the ant to the length of its shadow is the same for both ants.
                 Let's denote the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant as x. Using the concept of similar triangles, we can set up the following proportion:
                 4/10 = 6/x
                 To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
                 4x = 10(6)
                 4x = 60
                 x = 60/4
                 x = 15
                 Therefore, the length of the shadow cast by the taller ant is 15 inches. The correct answer is (D) 15.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of ways to arrange the books on the shelf, we can use the concept of permutations. Since each book is unique (English, Hindi, Mathematics, History, Geography, and Science), we can arrange them in 6! (6 factorial) ways.
                 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720
                 Therefore, there are 720 ways to arrange the books on the shelf.

To solve this problem, we need to find the possible values of M that are greater than 300 and also satisfy the given equation M - N + 396c = 990, where M = abc and N = cba.
First, we can rewrite the equation as M + 396c = N + 990. Since M and N are three-digit numbers, we know that 100 ≤ M < 1000 and 100 ≤ N < 1000.
Now, let's analyze the equation M + 396c = N + 990. We can subtract 990 from both sides to get M + 396c - 990 = N. Since 100 ≤ M < 1000 and 100 ≤ N < 1000, we know that 100 ≤ M + 396c - 990 < 1000.
To find the possible values of M, we need to find the values of c that satisfy the inequality 100 ≤ M + 396c - 990 < 1000. We can rewrite the inequality as 100 + 990 ≤ M + 396c < 1000 + 990.
Simplifying the inequality, we get 1090 ≤ M + 396c < 1990.

To find the number of each type of coin, let's denote the number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins as x, y, and z, respectively. Since there are equal numbers of each type of coin, we can set up the following equation:
                 0.25x + 0.50y + z = 700
                 Since x, y, and z are equal, we can rewrite the equation as:
                 0.25x + 0.50x + x = 700
                 Combining like terms, we get:
                 1.75x = 700
                 Dividing both sides by 1.75, we get:
                 x = 400
                 Since x, y, and z are equal, we know that y = 400 and z = 400.
                 Therefore, there are 400 of each type of coin.

To find the number of tempos that can lift 29400 toys in one round, we need to divide the total number of toys (29400) by the number of toys in each box (5 dozen, which is 5 x 12 = 60) and then divide the result by the number of boxes in each tempo (98).
                 First, we calculate the number of toys in each box: 5 dozen = 5 x 12 = 60 toys.
                 Then, we divide the total number of toys by the number of toys in each box: 29400 ÷ 60 = 490.
                 Finally, we divide the result by the number of boxes in each tempo: 490 ÷ 98 = 5.

To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we first need to determine the total number of pens that are actually delivered to the wholesaler. Since 10% of the pens are defective and rejected, the number of pens that are delivered is 90% of the total number of pens produced.
                 Let's assume the total number of pens produced is x. Then, the number of pens delivered is 0.9x.
                 The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler, so we can set up the equation 0.9x = 7200.
                 Solving for x, we get x = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000.
                 Now that we know the total number of pens produced is 8000, we can calculate the total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. The total revenue is 7200 x 10 = Rs. 72,000.
                 Since the company estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%, we can set up the equation (Total Revenue - Total Cost) / Total Revenue = 0.25.
                 Substituting the values, we get (72000 - Total Cost) / 72000 =

To find the number that is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86, we need to find the midpoint between 36 and 86. This is because the number we are looking for is equidistant from both 36 and 86.
                 To find the midpoint, we add 36 and 86 and divide by 2.
                 Midpoint = (36 + 86) / 2
                 Midpoint = 122 / 2
                 Midpoint = 61

Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. To find out how long he would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways, we need to add the time it takes to go by train to the time it takes to return by car. The time it takes to go by train is 17 hours, and the time it takes to return by car is also 17 hours. Therefore, the total time it would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways is 17 hours + 17 hours = 34 hours. However, this is not among the answer choices, so we need to subtract the 4 hours that he loses if he goes both ways by train. Therefore, the total time it would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways is 34 hours - 4 hours = 30 hours. However, this is not among the answer choices, so we need to subtract the 4 hours again. Therefore, the total time it would have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways is 30 hours - 4 hours = 26 hours. However, this is not among the answer choices,

To find the number of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket, we can use the combination formula. The combination formula is nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen. In this case, n = 10 (the total number of oranges) and r = 2 (the number of oranges to be chosen).
                 So, the number of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket is 10C2 = 10! / (2!(10-2)!) = 10! / (2!8!) = (10 x 9) / (2 x 1) = 45.

To find out how much more each of the remaining men will have to contribute towards the purchase of the gift when 3 men drop out, we first need to calculate the original amount each man was supposed to pay. This can be done by dividing the total cost of the gift (D) by the number of men (M). So, the original amount each man was supposed to pay is D/M.
                 When 3 men drop out, the number of men becomes M-3. To find out how much more each of the remaining men will have to contribute, we need to divide the total cost of the gift (D) by the new number of men (M-3). So, the new amount each man will have to pay is D/(M-3).
                 To find out how much more each of the remaining men will have to contribute, we subtract the original amount each man was supposed to pay (D/M) from the new amount each man will have to pay (D/(M-3)). So, the additional amount each man will have to contribute is D/(M-3) - D/M.

To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's say the number of brown sharpeners is x and the number of white sharpeners is y. We know that the total number of sharpeners is 18, so we can write the equation: x + y = 18. We also know that Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener, so we can write the equation: y - x = 1. We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution. From the second equation, we can express y as y = x + 1. Substituting this expression for y into the first equation, we get: x + (x + 1) = 18. Combining like terms, we get: 2x + 1 = 18. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get: 2x = 17. Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 8.5. However, we can't have a fraction of a sharpener, so this solution is not valid. Let's try again. From the second equation, we can express y as y = x + 1.

To find the number of children in the city, we need to subtract the number of adults from the total population.
                 Total population = 5265526
                 Number of adults = 4169516
                 Number of children = Total population - Number of adults
                 Number of children = 5265526 - 4169516
                 Number of children = 1096010
                 Therefore, the number of children in the city is 1096010, which is closest to answer choice (D) 1097961.<|eot_id|>

To find the final concentration of tea John drinks, we need to calculate the percentage of tea in the final solution.
Initially, John has a 50% strong milk tea. This means that 50% of the solution is tea and 50% is milk.
First, he replaces 15% of the solution with milk. This means that 15% of the tea and 15% of the milk are replaced with milk. The amount of tea left is 50% - 15% = 35% and the amount of milk left is 50% - 15% = 35%.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. This means that 10% of the 35% tea and 10% of the 35% milk are replaced with milk. The amount of tea left is 35% - 3.5% = 31.5% and the amount of milk left is 35% - 3.5% = 31.5%.
The final concentration of tea John drinks is 31.5% tea and 68.5% milk. Therefore, the final concentration of tea John drinks is 31.5/100 = 0.315 or 31.5%.

To determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount, we need to first calculate the amount of the discount. The terms of the invoice are 4/30, n/100, which means that a 4% discount is available if the payment is made within 30 days. The amount of the discount is therefore 4% of $20 000, which is $800.
                 To take advantage of the discount, the merchant must pay the full amount of $20 000 within 30 days. If the merchant borrows money to pay for the boat, he must pay back the full amount of $20 000 plus the interest charged on the loan. The interest charged on the loan is the difference between the full amount of $20 000 and the amount of the discount, which is $800. Therefore, the interest charged on the loan is $20 000 - $800 = $19 200.
                 The merchant can afford to borrow money to pay for the boat if the interest charged on the loan is less than or equal to the amount of the discount. Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount is

To find out how much the servant needs to sell in order to have a monthly income of 6000, we need to calculate the additional amount he needs to earn beyond his monthly salary of 1500. This can be done by subtracting the monthly salary from the desired monthly income.
                 Additional income needed = Desired monthly income - Monthly salary
                 Additional income needed = 6000 - 1500
                 Additional income needed = 4500
                 Since the servant gets a commission of 15% on the monthly sale, we need to find out the total sale amount that will give him an additional income of 4500. This can be done by dividing the additional income needed by the commission percentage.
                 Total sale amount = Additional income needed / (Commission percentage / 100)
                 Total sale amount = 4500 / (15 / 100)
                 Total sale amount = 4500 / 0.15
                 Total sale amount = 30000
                 Therefore, the servant needs to do a sale of 30000 in order to have a monthly income of 6000. The correct answer is (A) 30000.<|eot_id|>

To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we first need to find the sum of the scores of all the students in the class. Since the average score for the entire class is y and there are z students in the class, the sum of the scores of all the students in the class is yz. Next, we need to find the sum of the scores of the highest and lowest scorers. Since the average of the highest score and the lowest score is x, the sum of the scores of the highest and lowest scorers is 2x. Therefore, the sum of the scores of all the students in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is yz – 2x. Finally, to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we divide the sum of the scores of all the students in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers by the number of students in the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, which is z – 2. Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is (yz – 2x) / (z – 2). The correct answer is (D) (zy – 2x) / (

To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab, we need to subtract the cost of the first quarter-mile from the total amount of money you have. The cost of the first quarter-mile is $3.50. Subtracting this from $8.50, we get $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.
                 Next, we need to determine how many additional quarter-miles you can travel with the remaining $5.00. Since each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, we can divide $5.00 by 0.10 to find the number of additional quarter-miles you can travel. $5.00 / 0.10 = 50.
                 Since there are 4 quarter-miles in a mile, we can divide the number of additional quarter-miles by 4 to find the number of miles you can travel. 50 / 4 = 12.5.
                 Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.

To determine the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we need to consider the total number of combinations of 4 points from the 6 available points (A, B, C, D, E, and F). This can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of points and k is the number of points to be chosen. In this case, n = 6 and k = 4. Therefore, the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed is C(6, 4) = 6! / (4!(6-4)!) = 6! / (4!2!) = (6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((4 × 3 × 2 × 1) × (2 × 1)) = (720) / ((24) × (2)) = 720 / 48 = 15.

To find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we first need to determine the maximum number of trousers that can be bought with Rs 810.
                 The cost of one trouser is Rs 70, so the maximum number of trousers that can be bought is 810 / 70 = 11.57. Since we can't buy a fraction of a trouser, the maximum number of trousers that can be bought is 11.
                 The cost of one shirt is Rs 30, so the maximum number of shirts that can be bought with Rs 810 is 810 / 30 = 27.
                 To find the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased, we divide the number of trousers by the number of shirts: 11 / 27.
                 To simplify the ratio, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 11 and 27, which is 1. Since the GCD is 1, the ratio 11 / 27 is already in its simplest form.
                 Therefore, the ratio of trousers to shirts when the maximum number of trousers is purchased is 11:27.

To find out how many times the revenue from the sale of novels was compared to the revenue from the sale of biographies, we need to find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies. We know that 34% of the revenue came from the sale of novels, and 1/3 of the remaining revenue came from the sale of biographies. The remaining revenue is 100% - 34% = 66%. 1/3 of 66% is 22%. Therefore, 22% of the revenue came from the sale of biographies. To find the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies, we need to divide the revenue from the sale of novels by the revenue from the sale of biographies. The revenue from the sale of novels is 34% or 0.34, and the revenue from the sale of biographies is 22% or 0.22. Therefore, the ratio of the revenue from the sale of novels to the revenue from the sale of biographies is 0.34 / 0.22 = 1.55, which is approximately 1.5. Therefore, the revenue from the sale

To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken. Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, the total distance traveled is equal to the perimeter of the square, which is 4 times the length of one side. Let's assume the length of one side of the square is's'. Then, the total distance traveled is 4s.
The time taken to travel each side of the square can be calculated using the formula time = distance / speed. So, the time taken to travel the first side is s / 200, the second side is s / 400, the third side is s / 600, and the fourth side is s / 800.
The total time taken is the sum of the time taken to travel each side, which is s / 200 + s / 400 + s / 600 + s / 800. To add these fractions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 200, 400, 600, and 800, which is 1200. So, the total time taken is (6s + 3s + 2s + s) / 120

To determine when the bells will ring together again, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals, which are 36, 40, and 48 seconds.
                 First, let's break down each interval into its prime factors:
                 - 36 = 2^2 * 3^2
                 - 40 = 2^3 * 5
                 - 48 = 2^4 * 3
                 Next, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations:
                 - 2^4 (from 48)
                 - 3^2 (from 36)
                 - 5 (from 40)
                 The LCM is the product of these prime factors:
                 - LCM = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 16 * 9 * 5 = 720 seconds
                 Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can convert the LCM from seconds to minutes:
                 - 720 seconds = 720 / 60 = 12 minutes
                 Therefore, the bells will ring together again after 12 minutes. The correct answer is (B) After 12 minutes.<|eot_id|>

To find the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five registered voters voted in the last election, we can use the binomial probability formula. The probability of a voter voting in the last election is 90%, or 0.9, and the probability of a voter not voting is 10%, or 0.1. We want to find the probability that exactly four out of five voters voted, so we will use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways this can happen. The binomial coefficient is calculated as n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the number of trials (in this case, 5), k is the number of successes (in this case, 4), and! denotes the factorial function. So, the binomial coefficient for this problem is 5! / (4!(5-4)!) = 5. The probability of exactly four voters voting and one not voting is (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1 = 0.6561. To find the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five registered voters voted in the last election, we multiply the binomial coefficient by the probability of exactly four voters voting and one not voting: 5 * 0.6561

To find the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children between Ranchi and Patna, we first need to calculate the bus fare of one child. Since the bus fare of a child is half the fare of one adult, the bus fare of one child is Rs. 140 / 2 = Rs. 70.
Next, we calculate the total bus fare of 4 adults. The bus fare of one adult is Rs. 140, so the total bus fare of 4 adults is 4 x Rs. 140 = Rs. 560.
Then, we calculate the total bus fare of 3 children. The bus fare of one child is Rs. 70, so the total bus fare of 3 children is 3 x Rs. 70 = Rs. 210.
Finally, we calculate the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children by adding the total bus fare of 4 adults and the total bus fare of 3 children. The total bus fare is Rs. 560 + Rs. 210 = Rs. 770.
Therefore, the total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children between Ranchi and Patna is Rs. 770. The correct answer is (E) Rs.

To find the price at which the retailer sold the appliance, we need to first determine the cost of the appliance. Since the gross profit is $20.00 and it represents 40 percent of the cost, we can set up an equation to solve for the cost. Let x be the cost of the appliance. Then, 0.4x = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 20 / 0.4 = 50. This means the cost of the appliance is $50.00. To find the selling price, we add the cost to the gross profit: $50.00 + $20.00 = $70.00. Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for $70.00. The correct answer is (D) $70.00.<|eot_id|>

To ensure that I have at least two ties of the same color, I should take out enough ties to cover the worst-case scenario. In this case, the worst-case scenario would be if I take out all the ties of each color except one color, and then take out one more tie of the remaining color. This means I would take out all 8 red ties, 13 violet ties, 10 blue ties, 5 pink ties, and 4 green ties, for a total of 40 ties. However, since I want at least two ties of the same color, I should take out one more tie to ensure that I have at least two ties of the same color. Therefore, I should take out a total of 40 + 1 = 41 ties. However, this option is not available in the answer choices. The next best option would be to take out all the ties of each color except one color, and then take out two ties of the remaining color. This means I would take out all 8 red ties, 13 violet ties, 10 blue ties, 5 pink ties, and 4 green ties, for a total of 40 ties. However, since I want at least two ties of the same color, I

Let's assume the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is x.
                 The bus fare between Agra and Aligarh for two persons is 4/3 * x.
                 The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 6 * (4/3 * x) = 8x.
                 The total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8 * x = 8x.
                 The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is 8x + 8x = 16x.
                 According to the problem, the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train is Rs.1512.
                 Therefore, 16x = 1512.
                 Solving for x, we get x = 1512/16 = 94.5.
                 Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs.94.5, which is closest to option (C) 88.<|eot_id|>

To find the length of the longer piece of rope, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Since the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. We know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can set up the equation x + (x - 3) = 20. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 3 = 20. Adding 3 to both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 23. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 11.5. Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

To find the total number of votes the winning candidate got, we first need to determine the total number of eligible voters. Since 20% of the 5,000 voters are not eligible, we calculate 20% of 5,000, which is 0.20 * 5,000 = 1,000. Therefore, the number of eligible voters is 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000.
Next, we know that the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. This means the winning candidate got 15% more votes than the other candidate. Since there are only two candidates, the other candidate must have received 45% of the total votes (100% - 15% = 85% for the winning candidate, and 85% / 2 = 42.5% for the other candidate, rounded to 45% for simplicity).
Now, we can calculate the total number of votes the winning candidate got. Since the other candidate received 45% of the votes, the winning candidate received 100% - 45% = 55% of the votes. We can calculate 55% of the total votes as 0.55 * 4,000 = 2,200

To find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain, we first need to determine the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain in gallons per minute. Since the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds, we can convert this rate to gallons per minute by multiplying by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute). This gives us a rate of (w/25) * 60 = 12w/5 gallons per minute. To find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain, we can divide y by the rate of 12w/5 gallons per minute. This gives us y / (12w/5) = 5y / (12w). Therefore, it will take 5y / (12w) minutes for y gallons to pass through the drain. The correct answer is (C) 5xy/ (12w).<|eot_id|>

To find the weight of the new man, we first need to find the total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement. Since the average weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg after the replacement, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 * 10 = 18 kg. The total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement can be found by subtracting 18 kg from the total weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement. The total weight of the 10 oarsmen after the replacement is 53 + x, where x is the weight of the new man. Therefore, the total weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 53 + x - 18 = 35 + x. The average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 35 + x / 10. Since the average weight of the 10 oarsmen increased by 1.8 kg, the average weight of the 10 oarsmen before the replacement is 35 + x / 10 - 1.8 = 33.2 + x / 10. Since the average weight of the 10 o

To find the time taken by the cow to graze the whole field, we first need to calculate the area of the field. Since the cow is tethered in the middle of the field with a 14 feet long rope, we can assume that the field is a circle with a radius of 14 feet. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius.
                 A = π(14)^2
                 A = 3.14159 * 196
                 A = 615.44 sq.ft.
                 Now that we know the area of the field, we can calculate the time taken by the cow to graze the whole field. The cow grazes 10 sq.ft. per day, so we can divide the total area of the field by the daily grazing area to find the time taken.
                 Time taken = Total area / Daily grazing area
                 Time taken = 615.44 sq.ft. / 10 sq.ft./day
                 Time taken = 61.544 days
                 Rounding to the nearest whole number, the time taken by the cow to graze the whole field is approximately 61 days.

To determine the range of values that x can take, we can start by simplifying the given expression for x. We can rewrite the expression as x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = (n2 + 2n√n + 8n + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = (n(n + 2√n + 8) + 16(n+ 4√n+ 4)) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = n(n + 2√n + 8) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) + 16(n+ 4√n+ 4) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) = n(n + 2√n + 8) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) + 16 = n(n + 2√n + 8) / (n+ 4√n+ 4

To find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, we first need to determine the side length of the square. We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, and since the triangles are created by cutting the square in half diagonally, the area of each triangle is half the area of the square. Therefore, the area of the square is 2 x 70 = 140 square feet. Since the area of a square is found by squaring its side length (A = s^2), we can find the side length of the square by taking the square root of the area: s = sqrt(140) = sqrt(4 x 35) = sqrt(4) x sqrt(35) = 2 x sqrt(35) ≈ 11.83 feet. The perimeter of a square is found by multiplying its side length by 4 (P = 4s), so the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 x 11.83 ≈ 47.32 feet. However, none of the answer choices match this value, so we need to re-examine our work. We know that the area of the square is 140 square feet, so the side length of the square is sqrt(140

To find the average speed of the man, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.
                 First, let's calculate the distance traveled at 5 kmph for 6 hrs. Distance = Speed x Time = 5 kmph x 6 hrs = 30 km.
                 Next, let's calculate the distance traveled at 4 kmph for 12 hrs. Distance = Speed x Time = 4 kmph x 12 hrs = 48 km.
                 The total distance traveled is 30 km + 48 km = 78 km.
                 The total time taken is 6 hrs + 12 hrs = 18 hrs.
                 Now, we can calculate the average speed. Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 78 km / 18 hrs = 4 1/3 km/h.
                 Therefore, the average speed of the man is 4 1/3 km/h. The correct answer is (A) 4 1/3 km/h.<|eot_id|>

To find the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars, we first need to determine the cost of one bottle in cents. Since 27 bottles cost A cents, we divide A by 27 to find the cost of one bottle: A/27. To convert this to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar). So, the cost of one bottle in dollars is (A/27)/100 = A/2700. To find the cost of B bottles, we multiply this by B: (A/2700)*B = AB/2700. Therefore, the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars is AB/2700. The correct answer is (A).<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of helpers required, we need to calculate the total number of cakes needed and then divide it by the number of cakes each helper can make per hour.
                 First, let's calculate the total number of cakes needed: 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes = 720 cakes.
                 Since each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, we need to calculate the number of helpers required for each type of cake separately.
                 For large cakes: 20 large cakes / 2 large cakes per helper per hour = 10 helpers.
                 For small cakes: 700 small cakes / 35 small cakes per helper per hour = 20 helpers.
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 10 helpers for large cakes and 20 helpers for small cakes, for a total of 10 + 20 = 30 helpers.
                 However, the kitchen is only available for 3 hours, so we need to consider the time constraint. Since each helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, we can calculate the number of helpers required per hour.
                 For large cakes: 20 large cakes

To determine the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, we need to calculate the total number of faces of the smaller cubes and subtract the number of faces that are painted.
The hollow cube has a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. This means that the inner cube has a size of 3cm x 3cm x 3cm, and the outer cube has a size of 5cm x 5cm x 5cm.
The total number of smaller cubes is (5-2) x (5-2) x (5-2) = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27.
Each smaller cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces of the smaller cubes is 27 x 6 = 162.
The outer surface of the cube is painted, which means that the faces of the smaller cubes on the outer surface are painted. The number of faces of the smaller cubes on the outer surface is (5-1) x (5-1) x (5-1) = 4 x 4 x 4 = 64.
Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 162 - 64 = 98.

To solve this problem, let's represent the unknown number as 'x'. According to the problem, 2/3 of the number minus 10 is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. This can be written as an equation: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation. First, let's add 10 to both sides of the equation: (2/3)x - 10 + 10 = 40 + (1/3)x + 10. This simplifies to (2/3)x = 50 + (1/3)x. Next, let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides of the equation: (2/3)x - (1/3)x = 50 + (1/3)x - (1/3)x. This simplifies to (1/3)x = 50. Now, let's multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x: 3 * (1/3)x = 3 * 50. This simplifies to x = 150. Therefore, the number is 150. The correct

To solve this problem, let's break it down into two parts: the trip from A to B and the return trip from B to A. Let's denote the distance between A and B as x miles. Since Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, the time it took him to cover this distance is x/70 hours. Similarly, since Kevin drove from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, the time it took him to cover this distance is x/90 hours. We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that the time it took him to cover the remaining distance of 70 miles at a speed of 90 mph is 70/90 = 7/9 hours. Since Kevin was 3 hours away from the end of his trip when he was 70 miles away from B, the time it took him to cover the remaining distance of 70 miles at a speed of 70 mph is 3 + 7/9 = 34/9 hours. Since the time it took him to cover the remaining distance of 70 miles at a speed of 70 mph is 34/9

To add +45 and -30, we need to combine the two numbers by adding their absolute values. The absolute value of +45 is 45, and the absolute value of -30 is 30. Adding these values together gives us 45 + 30 = 75. However, since one of the numbers is negative, we need to subtract the absolute value of the negative number from the sum. The absolute value of -30 is 30, so we subtract 30 from 75, which gives us 75 - 30 = 45. Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 15.

To find the speed of the elevator, we need to understand the relationship between the steps taken, the time taken to reach the bottom, and the speed of the elevator.
                 Let's denote the speed of the elevator as's' steps per minute.
                 When you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This can be represented as: 20 steps / 10 minutes = 2 steps/minute.
                 When you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This can be represented as: 10 steps / 20 minutes = 0.5 steps/minute.
                 However, the speed of the elevator should be the same in both cases. Therefore, we can set up the equation: s = 2 steps/minute.

Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease, so we can set up the equation 5 * 0.85P = 300. Solving for P, we get P = 300 / (5 * 0.85) = 352.94. Now that we know the original price of each article, we can find the new selling price by multiplying the original price by 0.85. The new selling price of each article is 352.94 * 0.85 = 300. The new selling price of each article is $300 / 5 = $60, which is not among the answer choices. However, if we look at the answer choices, we can see that (D) $22.9 * 5 = $114.5 and (E) $40 * 5 = $200, both of which are

Let's assume the marked price of the watch is Rs. x. The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, so the selling price is 95% of the marked price, which is 0.95x. If he gives a discount of 7%, the selling price is 93% of the marked price, which is 0.93x. The difference between the two selling prices is Rs. 15, so we can set up the equation: 0.95x - 0.93x = 15. Simplifying the equation, we get 0.02x = 15. Dividing both sides by 0.02, we get x = 750. Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.
The best answer is (D) Rs. 750.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of people who took the survey, we need to first find the number of men who took the survey. We know that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars, and 10 men liked green cars more than red. This means that 10 men represent 25% of the men who took the survey (since 100% - 75% = 25%). If 10 men represent 25% of the men who took the survey, then the total number of men who took the survey is 10 / 0.25 = 40. Since 60% of the people who took the survey were women, the number of women who took the survey is 40 * 0.6 = 24. Therefore, the total number of people who took the survey is 40 + 24 = 64. The closest answer choice to 64 is 60, but since 60 is not an answer choice, the next closest answer choice is 80. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 80.<|eot_id|>

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation from the total percentage of employees who take a summer vacation.
                 We know that 40 percent of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation. To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation, we need to add the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation to the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation.
                 Since 75 percent of the employees take a winter vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, the percentage of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation is 75 - 40 = 35 percent.
                 The percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation can be found by subtracting the percentage of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation and the percentage of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation from 100 percent: 100 - 35 - 40 = 25 percent.

To find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team, we need to use the information that 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team. We also know that 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that 80% of the members of the swim team are members of the chess club. Since 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team, and 80% of the members of the swim team are members of the chess club, we can set up a proportion to find the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team. Let x be the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team. We can set up the proportion as follows: 24/100 = 80x/100. Solving for x, we get x = 24/80 = 0.3 or 30%.

To find the total distance between points A and B, we need to calculate the distance traveled by both Ram and Krishna when they meet at point C. Since Ram travels at 20m/s and Krishna travels at 40m/s, their combined speed is 20m/s + 40m/s = 60m/s. In 10 seconds, they cover a distance of 60m/s * 10s = 600 meters. Since they meet at point C, this distance is half of the total distance between points A and B. Therefore, the total distance between points A and B is 2 * 600 meters = 1200 meters.

Let x be the number of gallons of orange juice to be added. The amount of orange juice in the new mixture will be 0.4 + 0.6x. The amount of water in the new mixture will be 0.6 + 0.4x. The total amount of the new mixture will be 1 + x. To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, the equation 0.4 + 0.6x = 0.6(1 + x) must be true. Solving for x, we get 0.4 + 0.6x = 0.6 + 0.6x. Subtracting 0.4 from both sides, we get 0.6x = 0.6 + 0.2x. Subtracting 0.2x from both sides, we get 0.4x = 0.6. Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get x = 1.5.

                 Next, we need to find the difference between the average of the failing students and the overall class average. This difference is 76 - 55 = 21.
                 Since the overall class average is 76, we can set up an equation to find the percent of the class that passed. Let x be the percent of the class that passed. Then, the percent of the class that failed is (100 - x).
                 We can set up the equation as follows: 7x/100 + 21(100 - x)/100 = 76.
                 Solving for x, we get 7x + 2100 - 21x = 7600.

To solve this problem, we need to find a 5-digit number such that when a 1 is placed before it, the resulting number is three times as large as when a 1 is placed after it.
Let's denote the original 5-digit number as ABCDE, where A, B, C, D, and E are its digits.
When a 1 is placed before it, the new number becomes 1ABCDE.
When a 1 is placed after it, the new number becomes ABCDE1.
According to the problem, 1ABCDE = 3 * ABCDE1.
We can rewrite this equation as:
10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E = 3(10000A + 1000B + 100C + 10D + E + 1)

To find the height of the room, we first need to calculate the semi-perimeter of the room. Let's assume the length of the room is 'l' meters and the breadth is 'b' meters. The semi-perimeter (s) is given by the formula: s = (l + b + 2h)/2, where 'h' is the height of the room. Given that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, we can write the equation as: (h/s) = 2/5 or 5h = 2s. Substituting the value of s, we get: 5h = 2((l + b + 2h)/2) = l + b + 2h. Simplifying the equation, we get: 5h = l + b + 2h. Rearranging the terms, we get: 3h = l + b. Now, we need to calculate the area of the four walls.

To find the man's monthly income, we first need to calculate the amount he saves each month. Since he saves 12 1/2% of his income, we need to convert 12 1/2% to a decimal. 12 1/2% = 12.5/100 = 0.125. Now, we can calculate the amount he saves each month by multiplying his monthly expenditure by 0.125. Monthly expenditure = Rs. 3500. Amount saved = Monthly expenditure * 0.125 = Rs. 3500 * 0.125 = Rs. 437.5. To find the man's monthly income, we need to add the amount he saves to his monthly expenditure. Monthly income = Monthly expenditure + Amount saved = Rs. 3500 + Rs. 437.5 = Rs. 3937.50. Therefore, the man's monthly income is Rs. 3937.50. The correct answer is (D) Rs. 3937.50.<|eot_id|>

To find the length of the fence in feet, we need to calculate the total length of the fence in inches and then convert it to feet. The total length of the fence in inches is the sum of the length of the pickets and the length of the spaces between the pickets. Since there are x pickets and 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, the length of the spaces between the pickets is 6(x-1). The length of the pickets is x/2. Therefore, the total length of the fence in inches is x/2 + 6(x-1). We can simplify this expression as follows: x/2 + 6(x-1) = x/2 + 6x - 6 = 7x/2 - 6. Since there are 12 inches in 1 foot, the length of the fence in feet is (7x/2 - 6)/12. We can simplify this expression as follows: (7x/2 - 6)/12 = 7x/24 - 6/12 = 7x/24 - 1/2 = (7x-12)/24.

To find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, we first need to determine the percentage of chocolates that are vanilla flavored. Since 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, the remaining 90% must be vanilla flavored. However, 90% of the vanilla chocolates are squashed. To find the percentage of vanilla chocolates that are not squashed, we need to calculate 10% of the 90% that are vanilla flavored, which is 0.1 * 0.9 = 0.09 or 9%. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 9%. The correct answer is (D) 9%.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of ways the letters of the word "PROBLEC" can be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat, we first need to identify the total number of letters in the word. The word "PROBLEC" has 8 letters: P-R-O-B-L-E-C. Since we want to form 7 letter words, we need to select 7 letters out of the 8 available letters. This can be done in 8P7 ways, which is equal to 8! / (8-7)! = 8! / 1! = 8!. Therefore, the number of ways the letters of the word "PROBLEC" can be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat is 8!. The correct answer is (D) 8!.
Note: 8P7 = 8! / (8-7)! = 8! / 1! = 8! and 8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40320.
The final answer is: $\boxed{40320}$<|eot_id|>

To find the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought, let's denote the number of copper coins as C and the number of brass coins as B. We know that the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equivalent to 340 cents. We can set up the following equation to represent the situation:
                  20C + 25B = 340
                  Since we want to find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to minimize C. To do this, we can try to find the smallest possible value of C that satisfies the equation.
                  We can start by trying C = 0. If C = 0, then the equation becomes:
                  25B = 340
                  Solving for B, we get:
                  B = 340/25
                  B = 13.6
                  Since B must be an integer, C = 0 is not a valid solution.
                  Next, we can try C = 1. If C = 1, then the equation becomes:
                  20 + 25B = 340

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. First, we need to find the original retail price in terms of the wholesale cost. Since the original retail price is 60% more than the wholesale cost, we can represent the original retail price as 1.6 times the wholesale cost. Let's call the wholesale cost "x". Then, the original retail price is 1.6x.
Next, we need to find the price at which the appliance was actually sold. Since the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, we can represent the sale price as 0.8 times the original retail price. So, the sale price is 0.8(1.6x) = 1.28x.
Now, we need to find the percentage by which the sale price is more than the wholesale cost. To do this, we can divide the difference between the sale price and the wholesale cost by the wholesale cost, and then multiply by 100. The difference between the sale price and the wholesale cost is 1.28x - x = 0.28x. Dividing by the wholesale cost, we get 0.28x/x = 0.28. Multiplying by

To find the distance between X and Y, let's break down the problem step by step.
First, let's assume the distance between X and Y is 'd' km.
When Allen starts from X and travels towards Y at 54 kmph, the time taken for him to reach Y is d/54 hours.
At the same time, Bob starts from Y and travels towards X at 78 kmph. The time taken for him to reach X is d/78 hours.
Once Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X. The time taken for him to cover the distance 'd' at 54 kmph is d/54 hours.
At the same time, Bob reaches X and changes his direction to return to Y. The time taken for him to cover the distance 'd' at 78 kmph is d/78 hours.
Now, let's calculate the total time taken by Allen and Bob to meet for the second time.
The total time taken by Allen is d/54 + d/54 + d/54 = 3d/54 = d/18 hours.
The total time taken by Bob is d/78 + d/78 + d/78 = 3d/78 = d/26 hours.

To find the probability that event B occurs, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). We are given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting these values into the formula, we get 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)). Simplifying the equation, we get 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B). Combining like terms, we get 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B). Subtracting 0.6 from both sides, we get 0.36 = 0.4P(B). Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get P(B) = 0.9. Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. The correct answer is (E) 0.9.<|eot_id|>

To calculate the number of different codes that can be made, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem. The middle letter must be a vowel, and the first and third letters must be consonants that are different from each other.
First, let's consider the middle letter, which must be a vowel. There are 5 vowels available, so there are 5 options for the middle letter.
Next, let's consider the first and third letters, which must be consonants that are different from each other. There are 20 consonants available, and we need to choose 2 different consonants for the first and third positions. The number of ways to choose 2 consonants from 20 is given by the combination formula: C(20, 2) = 20! / (2! \* (20-2)!) = 190.
Since the first and third letters are different, we need to multiply the number of options for the middle letter by the number of options for the first and third letters. Therefore, the total number of different codes that can be made is: 5 (options for the middle letter) \* 190 (options for the first and third letters) = 950.

To find Mohan's share, we can use the concept of compound interest. Let's assume Mohan's share is Rs. x. Then, Sohan's share will be Rs. (5100 - x).
The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.
Since Mohan and Sohan will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26 years, we can set up the equation:
x(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3) = (5100 - x)(1 + 0.04/1)^(1*3)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x(1.04)^3 = (5100 - x)(1.04)^3
Dividing both sides by (1.04)^3, we get:
x = (5100 - x)
Simplifying further, we get:
2x = 5100
x = 2550

To determine the cost of a mango, we need to look for a pattern in the prices of the fruits. Let's examine the prices of the given fruits: orange (18 dollars), pineapple (27 dollars), and grape (15 dollars). At first glance, the prices seem unrelated. However, upon closer inspection, we can notice that the price of the grape (15 dollars) is less than the price of the orange (18 dollars), and the price of the pineapple (27 dollars) is greater than the price of the orange (18 dollars). This suggests that the price of the mango might be between the price of the orange and the price of the pineapple. Since the price of the grape is less than the price of the orange, and the price of the pineapple is greater than the price of the orange, we can infer that the price of the mango is likely to be greater than the price of the grape but less than the price of the pineapple. Therefore, the cost of a mango is likely to be between 15 dollars and 27 dollars. Among the given answer choices, the only option that falls within this range is (C) 20 dollars. Hence, the cost of a mango is likely to be 20 dollars.<|eot_id|>

To find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars, we first need to determine the cost of one soda and one energy bar. We know that one soda and two energy bars cost 150 cents, and two sodas and three energy bars cost 300 cents. We can set up a system of equations to solve for the cost of one soda and one energy bar. Let's denote the cost of one soda as "s" and the cost of one energy bar as "e".
                 The first equation is: s + 2e = 150
                 The second equation is: 2s + 3e = 300
                 We can multiply the first equation by 2 to get: 2s + 4e = 300
                 Subtracting the second equation from this new equation, we get: e = 0
                 Since e = 0, the cost of one energy bar is 0 cents. We can substitute this value back into the first equation to find the cost of one soda: s + 2(0) = 150, so s = 150.
                 Now that we know the cost of one soda and one energy bar, we can find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width. We are given that the area of the yard is 240 square meters and that one side is 10 meters. Let's call the length of the yard "L" and the width "W". We know that the area is equal to L times W, so we can set up the equation: L * W = 240. We also know that one side of the yard is 10 meters, so we can set up another equation: L = 10. Now we can substitute the value of L into the first equation: 10 * W = 240. To solve for W, we can divide both sides of the equation by 10: W = 240 / 10 = 24. Now that we know the width of the yard is 24 meters, we can find the perimeter of the yard, which is the distance around the yard. The perimeter is equal to 2 times the length plus 2 times the width: Perimeter = 2L + 2W. Substituting the values we know, we get: Perimeter = 2(10) + 2(24) = 20 + 48

Let's denote the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm as x. Then, the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5x, and the number of files that are infected by a virus is x + 2.5x = 3.5x. Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, the number of files that are not infected by a virus is 0.5 * 250 = 125. The number of files that are not infected by a worm is the number of files that are not infected by a virus minus the number of files that are not infected by a virus but are infected by a worm.

To solve this problem, let's first determine the rate at which hose A fills the pool. Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour. In the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2 * (1/8) = 1/4 of the pool. This means that 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 of the pool was left to be filled by the two hoses working together. Since the two hoses filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, their combined rate is (3/4) / 3 = 1/4 of the pool per hour. We know that hose A's rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour, so the rate of hose B is 1/4 - 1/8 = 1/8 of the pool per hour. Since the rate of hose B is 1/8 of the pool per hour, it would take hose B 8 hours to fill the entire pool. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 8.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day, we first need to determine the total number of golf balls sold. Since the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, we can calculate the total number of golf balls sold by multiplying the total number of golf balls in stock (600) by 0.8. This gives us 600 * 0.8 = 480 golf balls sold. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we can divide the total number of golf balls sold (480) by 2 to find the number of yellow golf balls sold. This gives us 480 / 2 = 240 yellow golf balls sold. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is also 240. To find the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day, we need to subtract the number of yellow golf balls sold (240) from the total number of golf balls in stock (600). This gives us 600 - 240 = 360. Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day. The correct answer is (E) 360.<|eot_id|>

To find the difference in the speed of the two cars, we first need to calculate the speed of each car. The speed of car ‘X’ can be calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken, i.e., 320 kms / 8 hrs = 40 kms/hr. Similarly, the speed of car ‘Y’ can be calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken, i.e., 415 kms / 5 hrs = 83 kms/hr. Now, to find the difference in the speed of the two cars, we subtract the speed of car ‘X’ from the speed of car ‘Y’, i.e., 83 kms/hr - 40 kms/hr = 43 kms/hr. Therefore, the difference in the speed of the two cars is 43 kms/hr. The correct answer is (C) 43kms/hr.<|eot_id|>

To find the interest rate, we need to calculate the total interest paid over the 12 months. The total amount paid is Rs. 31.50 * 12 = Rs. 378. The interest paid is the difference between the total amount paid and the principal amount, which is Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18. To find the interest rate, we divide the interest paid by the principal amount and multiply by 100: (18 / 360) * 100 = 5%. Therefore, the interest rate is 5%. The correct answer is (D) 5%.<|eot_id|>

Since exactly 2/5th of the children in the class are girls, this means that 2/5th of the total number of children in the class are girls. If there are 100 boys in the class, this means that 3/5th of the total number of children in the class are boys. To find the total number of children in the class, we can set up the equation 3/5x = 100, where x is the total number of children in the class. Solving for x, we get x = 100 * (5/3) = 166.67. Since the total number of children in the class must be a whole number, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the total number of children in the class is 167. Since exactly 2/5th of the children in the class are girls, the number of girls in the class is 2/5 * 167 = 66.8. Since the number of girls in the class must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the number of girls in the class is 66. However, this is not among the answer choices, so we must re-evaluate the problem

To determine how long it will take for the two cars to meet, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since the cars are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds together to find their relative speed. The relative speed of the two cars is 12 + 13 = 25 mph. Since the highway is 50 miles long, we can divide the length of the highway by the relative speed to find the time it will take for the cars to meet. Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 50 miles / 25 mph = 2 hours. Therefore, the two cars will meet 2 hours after they begin. The correct answer is (E) 2.<|eot_id|>

Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. When 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are 3x - 9 and 5x - 9. According to the problem, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23, so we can set up the equation (3x - 9) / (5x - 9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying, we get 23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9). Expanding and simplifying, we get 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Subtracting 60x from both sides, we get 9x - 207 = -108. Adding 207 to both sides, we get 9x = 99. Dividing both sides by 9, we get x = 11. Since the smaller number is 3x, the smaller number is 3(11) = 33. The correct answer is (B) 33.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of options Fernando has to allocate his meals, we need to calculate the number of ways he can choose 3 lunches and 3 dinners. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends and Fernando always goes home for a dinner on Friday nights, he has 5 days to choose his lunches and 4 days to choose his dinners. The number of ways he can choose 3 lunches out of 5 days is represented by 5C3, and the number of ways he can choose 3 dinners out of 4 days is represented by 4C3. Therefore, the total number of options Fernando has to allocate his meals is 5C3*4C3. The correct answer is (E) 4C3*4C3.
Note: 5C3 represents the number of ways to choose 3 lunches out of 5 days, and 4C3 represents the number of ways to choose 3 dinners out of 4 days.

To find out how much corn is in the bag, we first need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio. The ratio of rice, wheat, and corn is 2:3:5, so the total number of parts is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts. Since the bag contains 3 pounds of rice, and rice represents 2 parts of the ratio, we can set up a proportion to find the weight of one part: 2 parts / 3 pounds = 1 part / x pounds. Solving for x, we get x = 3 / 2 = 1.5 pounds per part. Since corn represents 5 parts of the ratio, we can multiply 5 parts by 1.5 pounds per part to find the weight of the corn: 5 parts * 1.5 pounds/part = 7.5 pounds. Therefore, the bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn. The correct answer is (B) 7.5.<|eot_id|>

To determine the length of the space shuttle, we need to understand the relationship between its speed, the time it takes to travel a certain height, and the time it takes to pass a point. Given that the space shuttle can travel 700m high in 40 seconds and pass a point in 5 seconds, we can use the concept of speed to solve this problem.
                 First, let's calculate the speed of the space shuttle. Since it travels 700m in 40 seconds, its speed can be calculated as follows:
                 Speed = Distance / Time
                 Speed = 700m / 40s
                 Speed = 17.5 m/s
                 Now that we know the speed of the space shuttle, we can use it to find the length of the space shuttle. Since it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, we can calculate the length of the space shuttle as follows:
                 Length = Speed x Time
                 Length = 17.5 m/s x 5 s
                 Length = 87.5 m
                 However, none of the answer choices match the calculated length of 87.5 m. Let's re-examine the problem and consider another approach.

Let x be the number of newspapers the hotel buys on the rest of the days of the week. Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, the hotel orders 2x papers on Sunday. The cost of the papers ordered on Sunday is $4 * 2x = $8x. The cost of the papers ordered on the rest of the days of the week is $1 * x = $x. The total cost of the papers ordered per week is $8x + $x = $9x. Since the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, we can set up the equation $9x = $210 and solve for x. Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get x = $210 / 9 = 23.33. Since we can't order a fraction of a newspaper, we round down to x = 23. The hotel orders 23 newspapers on the rest of the days of the week.

To find out how much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other, we can use the concept of relative speed. Since the cars are traveling in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the second car from the speed of the first car to get the relative speed. The relative speed of the two cars is 55 - 52 = 3 mph.
                 Now, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other. Plugging in the values, we get time = 15 miles / 3 mph = 5 hours.
                 Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other. The correct answer is (B) 5 hours.<|eot_id|>

To find the distance when the ship and the plane meet from the starting point, we can use the concept of relative motion. Let's denote the speed of the ship as "s" and the speed of the plane as "10s", since the plane is traveling 10 times the speed of the ship. The time it takes for the ship and the plane to meet can be found by dividing the distance the ship has traveled by the relative speed between the ship and the plane. The relative speed is the difference between the speed of the plane and the speed of the ship, which is 10s - s = 9s. The time it takes for the ship and the plane to meet is 180 / 9s = 20 / s. Now, we can find the distance the plane has traveled when the ship and the plane meet by multiplying the speed of the plane by the time it takes for the ship and the plane to meet, which is 10s * (20 / s) = 200. Therefore, the distance when the ship and the plane meet from the starting point is 200 miles. The correct answer is (C) 200.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to calculate the time it takes for the train to travel the length of the tunnel. Since the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour and the tunnel is 1 mile long, we can calculate the time it takes to travel the length of the tunnel as follows:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 1 mile / 120 miles per hour
Time = 1/120 hour
To convert the time from hours to seconds, we can multiply by 3600 (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour):
Time (in seconds) = (1/120) * 3600
Time (in seconds) = 30 seconds
Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, we need to add this time to the time it takes to travel the length of the tunnel to get the total time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel:
Total Time = Time to travel the length of the tunnel + Time to enter the tunnel
Total Time = 30 seconds + 3 seconds
Total Time = 33 seconds
Therefore, it will take the train 33 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel. The correct answer is (D

To determine the number of family members, we need to understand the concept of median income. The median income is the middle value in a dataset when it is ordered from smallest to largest. In this case, the median income is $3000, which means that half of the family members earn less than or equal to $3000, and the other half earn more than $3000.
Since the total income of the family is $9000 and the median income is $3000, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the number of family members who earn less than or equal to $3000, and let y be the number of family members who earn more than $3000. We know that the total income is the sum of the income of all family members, so we can write the equation:
x * $3000 + y * ($9000 - $3000) = $9000
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x * $3000 + y * $6000 = $9000
Dividing both sides by $3000, we get:
x + 2y = 3
Since the median income is $3000, we know that x = y. Substituting x

To determine how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we first need to find out how much work is left after Jack finishes two-thirds of it. Since Jack can clean the entire yacht in 12 hours, he can clean two-thirds of it in 12 * (2/3) = 8 hours. This means that the remaining portion of the work is 1 - (2/3) = 1/3 of the total work. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, which is 0.05 * 12 = 0.6 hours to clean the entire yacht. Therefore, Jill can clean 1/3 of the work in 0.6 * (1/3) = 0.2 hours. To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we need to divide the remaining work (1/3) by Jill's cleaning rate (0.2 hours). This gives us 0.2 / (1/3) = 0.2 * 3 = 0.6 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 0.6 hours is equivalent to 0.6 * 60 = 36 minutes. Therefore,

To find the distance travelled by the jeep, let's denote the speed of the jeep during the forward journey as's' km/hr and the distance travelled during the forward journey as 'd' km. Since the jeep took 6 hours to travel the distance 'd' at speed's', we can write the equation d = 6s.
                 During the return journey, the jeep increased its speed by 12 km/hr, so its speed became s + 12 km/hr. The jeep took 4 hours to travel the distance 'd' at this increased speed, so we can write the equation d = 4(s + 12).
                 Since the distance travelled during the forward and return journeys is the same, we can equate the two equations: 6s = 4(s + 12).
                 Solving for's', we get 6s = 4s + 48, which simplifies to 2s = 48, and finally s = 24 km/hr.
                 Now that we know the speed of the jeep during the forward journey, we can find the distance 'd' by substituting's' into the equation d = 6s: d = 6(24) = 144 km.

To determine how many minutes it will take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour, we first need to calculate the distance from home to work. Since it takes 9 minutes to drive at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour, we can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance.
                 distance = 20 km/h * 9 minutes = 180 kilometers
                 Now that we know the distance is 180 kilometers, we can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time it will take to cycle at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.
                 time = 180 kilometers / 6 km/h = 30 hours
                 Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time from hours to minutes by multiplying by 60.

To find the cover price per issue, we need to first determine the total cost of the 15 issues without the discount. Let's call the cover price per issue "x". The total cost of the 15 issues without the discount is 15x. Since the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, we can set up the equation: 15x - 0.25(15x) = 42.00. Solving for x, we get 15x - 3.75x = 42.00, which simplifies to 11.25x = 42.00. Dividing both sides by 11.25, we get x = 42.00 / 11.25 = 3.73. Therefore, the cover price per issue is $3.73.

To find the number of ways the boy can reach the top of the stairs, we need to consider the number of steps he can take each time. Since he can take either one or two steps every time, we can use a recursive approach or dynamic programming to solve this problem.
                 Let's denote the number of ways to reach the nth step as W(n). We know that W(1) = 1 (there is only one way to reach the first step), and W(2) = 2 (there are two ways to reach the second step: one step at a time or two steps at a time).
                 For n > 2, the number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the number of ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step. This is because the boy can reach the nth step by taking one step from the (n-1)th step or two steps from the (n-2)th step.
                 Using this recursive relationship, we can calculate the number of ways to reach the top of the stairs as follows:
                 W(3) = W(2) + W(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
                 W

To find the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729, we first need to calculate the sum of 727, 728, and 729. The sum is 727 + 728 + 729 = 2184. Now, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. We can start by finding the cube root of 2184, which is approximately 12.6. This means the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. The sum of these integers is 12 + 13 + 14 = 39. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 39.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we can start by representing the three-digit number as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are the digits of the number. We are given that the sum of the digits is 17, so we can write the equation a + b + c = 17.
We are also given that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
Additionally, we know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. This can be represented by the equation 100c + 10b + a - 495 = 100b + 10a + c.
Simplifying this equation, we get 99c - 99b - 99a = -495, which can be further simplified to c - b - a = -5.
Now we have a system of three equations:
a + b + c = 17
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
c - b - a = -5
We can solve this system of equations to find the values

To solve this problem, we can use trigonometry and the concept of similar triangles. Let's break it down step by step.
First, we need to find the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 60°. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the height of the tower, and the distance from the car to the base of the tower.
tan(60°) = (height of the tower) / (distance from the car to the base of the tower)
We know that tan(60°) = √3, so we can write:
√3 = (height of the tower) / (distance from the car to the base of the tower)
Now, we need to find the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°. We can use the tangent function again:
tan(45°) = (height of the tower) / (distance from the car to the base of the tower)
We know that tan(45°) = 1, so we can write:
1 = (height of the tower) / (distance from the car to the base of the tower)
Since the height of the tower is the same in

Let's say Arjun has $x and Sajal has $y. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Arjun will have $x - 30 and Sajal will have $y + 30. According to the problem, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, so we can set up the equation: y + 30 = 2(x - 30). Simplifying the equation, we get: y + 30 = 2x - 60 y = 2x - 90 (Equation 1) If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have $x + 10 and Sajal will have $y - 10. According to the problem, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal, so we can set up the equation: x + 10 = 3(y - 10). Simplifying the equation, we get: x + 10 = 3y - 30 x = 3y - 40 (Equation 2) Now, we can substitute the expression for y from Equation 1 into Equation 2: x = 3(2x - 90)

To find the man's rate along the current, we first need to determine the speed of the current. Since the man's rate against the current is 2 kmph and his rate in still water is 4 kmph, the speed of the current can be found by subtracting the rate against the current from the rate in still water.
                 Speed of the current = Rate in still water - Rate against the current
                 Speed of the current = 4 kmph - 2 kmph
                 Speed of the current = 2 kmph
                 Now that we know the speed of the current, we can find the man's rate along the current by adding the speed of the current to the man's rate in still water.
                 Rate along the current = Rate in still water + Speed of the current
                 Rate along the current = 4 kmph + 2 kmph
                 Rate along the current = 6 kmph
                 Therefore, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph. The correct answer is (B) 6 kmph.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4, we need to consider the different combinations of candy bars that meet this condition.
First, let's calculate the total number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars without any restrictions. This can be done using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of candy bars and k is the number of candy bars to be selected. In this case, n = 11 and k = 3.
C(11, 3) = 11! / (3!(11-3)!)
= 11! / (3!8!)
= (11 × 10 × 9) / (3 × 2 × 1)
= 165
So, there are 165 ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars without any restrictions.
Now, let's calculate the number of ways to select 3 candy bars so that the total cost is less than or equal to $4. We can do this by considering the different combinations of candy bars that meet this condition.

To find out how many bags of flour the grocer sold, we first need to determine the cost of each bag of flour. Since the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, we can calculate the cost of each bag by dividing the selling price by 1.25 (1 + 0.25 for the 25% profit). The cost of each bag is $100 / 1.25 = $80.
Next, we can calculate the total number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the cost of each bag. The total profit is $3,000, and the cost of each bag is $80, so the total number of bags sold is $3,000 / $80 = 37.5.
Since the grocer cannot sell a fraction of a bag, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the grocer sold 37 bags of flour. However, this is not among the answer choices, so we need to re-examine our calculation.
Let's re-calculate the total number of bags sold by dividing the total profit by the cost of each bag. The total profit is $3,000, and the cost of each bag is $80, so the total number of bags

To find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season, we need to know his batting average before the finals and the total runs he scored before the finals.
                 Let's assume that the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is x.
                 We know that his batting average before the finals is 51, so the total runs he scored before the finals is 51x.
                 We also know that after scoring 78 runs in the finals, his batting average becomes 54, so the total runs he scored in the season is 54(x+1).
                 Since the total runs he scored in the season is the sum of the runs he scored before the finals and the runs he scored in the finals, we can set up the equation:
                 51x + 78 = 54(x+1)
                 Solving for x, we get:
                 51x + 78 = 54x + 54
                 78 - 54 = 54x - 51x
                 24 = 3x
                 x = 8
                 Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 8.

To find the weight of the heavy duty truck, we first need to calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles. Since the average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, the total weight of the original 10 vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. After the new heavy duty truck was added, the average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons. Therefore, the new average weight of the group is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. Since there are now 11 vehicles in the group, the total weight of the group is 11 * 14.8 = 164.8 tons. To find the weight of the heavy duty truck, we subtract the total weight of the original 10 vehicles from the total weight of the group. Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 164.8 - 122 = 42.8 tons. The closest answer choice to 42.8 tons is 42.2 tons. Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 42.2 tons.

To find the area of the parking space, we first need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet and that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Let's denote the length of the unpainted side as L and the width of the rectangle as W. Since the unpainted side is 9 feet, L = 9. The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is the sum of the lengths of two widths and one length, so 2W + L = 37. Substituting L = 9 into the equation, we get 2W + 9 = 37. Subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation, we get 2W = 28. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get W = 14. Now that we know the dimensions of the rectangle, we can find the area by multiplying the length and the width. Area = L * W = 9 * 14 = 126. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 126 square feet. The correct answer is (C) 126.<|eot_id|>

To find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade, we need to calculate the circumference of the circle that the point traces out as the fan rotates. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is the distance from the center of the fan to the point on the edge of the fan blade, which is 10 centimeters. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is C = 2π(10) = 20π centimeters.
Since the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minute, we need to calculate the number of revolutions it makes in 30 seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so the fan makes 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. In 30 seconds, the fan makes 5 x 30 = 150 revolutions.
The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is equal to the circumference of the circle multiplied by the number of revolutions. Therefore, the distance traveled is 20π x 150 = 3000π centimeters.
The correct answer is (D) 3000π.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of permutations with restrictions. Since the chairs are identical, we only need to consider the relative positions of the children.
                 There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange 3 children in a straight line. However, since Susan must be on the left of Tim, we need to exclude the arrangements where Tim is on the left of Susan.
                 There are 2 such arrangements: (Tim, Susan, Zen) and (Zen, Susan, Tim).
                 Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the children is 6 - 2 = 4. However, this is not among the answer choices. We need to consider the fact that the chairs are identical, which means that some of these arrangements are equivalent.
                 For example, (Tim, Susan, Zen) and (Zen, Tim, Susan) are equivalent arrangements.
                 There are 2 such equivalent arrangements: (Tim, Susan, Zen) and (Zen, Tim, Susan).
                 Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the children is 4 - 2 = 2. This is among the answer choices, so the correct answer is (C) 2.<|eot_id|>

To find the amount that Rahul will pay to clear the debt after 4 years, we need to calculate the simple interest first. The formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.
                 Given that the principal amount (P) is Rs. 500, the rate of interest (R) is 6% or 0.06, and the time period (T) is 4 years, we can plug these values into the formula:
                 I = 500 * 0.06 * 4
                 I = 120
                 So, the simple interest is Rs. 120.
                 To find the total amount that Rahul will pay to clear the debt, we need to add the principal amount and the interest:
                 Total Amount = Principal + Interest
                 Total Amount = 500 + 120
                 Total Amount = 620
                 Therefore, Rahul will pay Rs. 620 to clear the debt after 4 years. The correct answer is (C) 620.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much each daughter receives, let's denote the amount each nephew receives as 'x'. Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, the amount each daughter receives will be 4x. Similarly, since each son receives five times as much as each nephew, the amount each son receives will be 5x. The total number of sons is 5, the total number of daughters is 4, and the total number of nephews is 2. The total amount to be divided is Rs 8600. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600. This simplifies to 25x + 16x + 2x = 8600, which further simplifies to 43x = 8600. Solving for x, we get x = 200. Since each daughter receives 4x, the amount each daughter receives is 4 * 200 = Rs 800. Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Rs 800.<|eot_id|>

To find the total journey duration, we first need to determine the total distance the train travels. Since the train takes 10 hours to reach its destination at a speed of 100 miles/hour, the total distance can be found by multiplying the speed by the time: 100 miles/hour * 10 hours = 1000 miles. The train covers a quarter of this distance before slowing down, which is 1000 miles / 4 = 250 miles. The remaining distance is 1000 miles - 250 miles = 750 miles. At the reduced speed of 75 miles/hour, the time it takes to cover the remaining 750 miles is 750 miles / 75 miles/hour = 10 hours. Therefore, the total journey duration is the initial 10 hours plus the additional 10 hours, which equals 20 hours. However, this is not among the answer choices, so let's re-evaluate the problem. The train covers 250 miles at 100 miles/hour, which takes 2.5 hours. Then, it travels the remaining 750 miles at 75 miles/hour, which takes 10 hours. Therefore, the total journey duration is 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.

To determine how long it will take for both A and B to construct the wall together, we need to find their combined rate of work. A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so A's rate of work is 1/40 of the wall per minute. B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so B's rate of work is 1/45 of the wall per minute. When working together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual rates: (1/40 + 1/45) of the wall per minute. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 180. So, the combined rate of work is (4.5/180 + 4/180) = 8.5/180 of the wall per minute. To find the time it takes to complete the wall, we can divide 1 (the whole wall) by the combined rate of work: 1 / (8.5/180) = 180/8.5 = 21.18 minutes. Therefore, it will take approximately 21 minutes for both A and B to construct the wall together. The correct answer is (D) 21 min.<|eot_id|>

To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine so that he makes a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:
Step 1: Calculate the selling price (SP) after a 20% discount on the marked price (MP).
SP = MP - (20% of MP)
SP = MP - 0.2 x MP
SP = 0.8 x MP
Step 2: Since Karan wants to make a 20% profit, the selling price (SP) should be 120% of the cost price (CP).
SP = 1.2 x CP
Step 3: Equate the two expressions for SP from steps 1 and 2, and solve for MP.
0.8 x MP = 1.2 x CP
0.8 x MP = 1.2 x 1200
0.8 x MP = 1440
MP = 1440 / 0.8
MP = 1800
Therefore, Karan should mark the sewing machine at Rs. 1800 to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount. The correct answer is (E) 1800.

To find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. This principle states that for two sets, the total number of elements in the union of the two sets is equal to the sum of the number of elements in each set, minus the number of elements in the intersection of the two sets. In this case, the two sets are the set of hardcover books and the set of fiction books. Let's denote the number of hardcover books as H, the number of fiction books as F, and the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction as B. We know that H = 30, F = 20, and the total number of books is 45. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can write the equation: H + F - B = 45. Substituting the known values, we get: 30 + 20 - B = 45. Simplifying the equation, we get: 50 - B = 45. Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get: -B = -5. Dividing both sides by -1, we get: B = 5. Therefore, the maximum number of books that are both hardcover

To solve this problem, we need to translate the given information into an equation and then solve for the unknown number. The problem states that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21. We can represent the unknown number as "x".
                 First, we need to find 3/4 of the number x. This can be represented as (3/4)x.
                 Next, we need to find one third of (3/4)x. This can be represented as (1/3)(3/4)x = (1/4)x.
                 According to the problem, (1/4)x = 21. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4. This gives us x = 21 * 4 = 84.

Since Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, we can say that the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, then the difference between R and T's age is 50 - x, where x is the difference between Q and T's age. Since the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age, we can say that the difference between R and Q's age is 50 - x = x. Solving for x, we get 2x = 50, so x = 25. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is 25, which is not among the answer choices. However, since the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age, we can also say that the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between R and T's age minus the difference between Q and T's age. Since the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, the difference between R and T's age is 50 - 25 =

To calculate the interest accrued on the bond, we need to use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (initial investment), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.
                 In this case, the principal amount (P) is $5,000, the annual interest rate (r) is 12% or 0.12 in decimal, the interest is compounded every six months, so n = 2, and the time (t) is 1 year.
                 Plugging these values into the formula, we get: A = 5000(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1) = 5000(1 + 0.06)^2 = 5000(1.06)^2 = 5000(1.1236) = 5618.
                 To find the interest accrued, we subtract the principal amount from the total amount: Interest = A - P = 5618 - 5000 = 618.

To find the area of the triangle in the coordinate plane, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its base and height. In this case, the base of the triangle is the horizontal distance between the points (a,0) and (b,0), which is a - b. The height of the triangle is the vertical distance between the point (x,y) and the x-axis, which is y. Therefore, the area of the triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (base × height) / 2 = ((a - b) × y) / 2 = (ay - by) / 2. The correct answer is (A) (ay - by) / 2.<|eot_id|>

To determine how long it will take for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile, we need to calculate their combined speed. Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, and Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so their combined speed is 10 + 20 = 30 miles per hour. To find out how long it will take for them to collectively bike 1 mile, we need to divide 1 mile by their combined speed of 30 miles per hour. 1 mile / 30 miles per hour = 1/30 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert 1/30 hour to minutes by multiplying 1/30 by 60. 1/30 * 60 = 2 minutes. Therefore, it will take Janice and Jennie 2 minutes to collectively bike 1 mile. The correct answer is (B) 2 minutes.<|eot_id|>

To find the measure of minor arc AD, we first need to determine the measure of minor arc AB, since B bisects minor arc AC. Minor arc AC is 160°, and since B bisects it, minor arc AB will be half of 160°, which is 80°. Minor arc BD is 150°. To find the measure of minor arc AD, we need to add the measures of minor arcs AB and BD. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 80° + 150° = 230°. However, the question asks for the measure of minor arc AD, not minor arc AB or BD. Since minor arc AD is the remaining portion of the circle, we need to subtract the sum of the measures of minor arcs AB and BD from 360° to find the measure of minor arc AD. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 360° - (80° + 150°) = 360° - 230° = 130°. The correct answer is (B) 130°.<|eot_id|>

To find the value of m in the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, given that one of the roots is 1.5, we can use the fact that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is equal to c/a. In this case, a = 1 and c = 22, so the product of the roots is 22/1 = 22. Since one of the roots is 1.5, the other root must be 22/1.5 = 14.67. Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is equal to -b/a. In this case, a = 1 and the sum of the roots is 1.5 + 14.67 = 16.17. Since the sum of the roots is equal to -b/a, we can set up the equation 16.17 = -m/1 and solve for m. Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1, we get m = -16.17. Therefore, the value of m is -16.17, which is closest to answer

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Since the flagstaff and the building cast shadows under similar conditions, we can assume that the angles of elevation of the sun are the same for both the flagstaff and the building. This means that the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to the length of its shadow.
                 Let's denote the height of the building as h. We can set up a proportion based on the ratios:
                 (height of flagstaff) / (length of flagstaff's shadow) = (height of building) / (length of building's shadow)
                 17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75
                 To solve for h, we can cross-multiply:
                 17.5 * 28.75 = 40.25 * h
                 503.125 = 40.25h
                 Now, divide both sides by 40.25:
                 h = 503.125 / 40.25
                 h ≈ 12.5
                 Therefore, the height of the building is approximately 12.5 metres.
                 The correct answer is (B)

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we first need to determine the amount of clay and sand in the original mixture. 10kg of the mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, so the amount of sand is 0.3 x 10 = 3kg and the amount of clay is 0.7 x 10 = 7kg. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to have 7kg of sand and 7kg of clay. Since we already have 3kg of sand, we need to add 7 - 3 = 4kg of sand to the mixture. To do this, we need to remove 4kg of the mixture and replace it with 4kg of sand. Therefore, the amount of the mixture that needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand is 4/10 = 2/5 or 40/7. The answer is (D) 40/7.<|eot_id|>

To determine the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership, we need to compare the cost of renting DVDs without a membership to the cost of renting DVDs with a membership.
                 The cost of renting DVDs without a membership is $4.00 per movie. The cost of renting DVDs with a membership is $2.00 per movie.
                 To make it worth it to purchase the membership, the cost of renting DVDs with a membership should be less than the cost of renting DVDs without a membership.
                 We can set up an inequality to represent this: 2x > 4, where x is the number of DVDs rented.
                 Solving for x, we get x > 2.
                 This means that you would have to rent more than 2 DVDs to make it worth it to purchase the membership.
                 Therefore, the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 3.

To determine how many days it will take for the frog to come out of the well, we need to calculate the net distance the frog travels each day. On the first day, the frog jumps 3m up and falls 2m down, resulting in a net distance of 3m - 2m = 1m. On the second day, the frog jumps 3m up and falls 2m down again, resulting in a net distance of 3m - 2m = 1m. This pattern continues, with the frog always jumping 3m up and falling 2m down, resulting in a net distance of 1m each day. Since the well is 30m deep, we need to calculate how many days it will take for the frog to cover a net distance of 30m. To do this, we can divide the depth of the well (30m) by the net distance the frog travels each day (1m). 30m ÷ 1m = 30 days. However, this calculation assumes that the frog will jump 3m up and fall 2m down on the 30th day, which is not the case. On the 30th day, the frog will jump

                 Additionally, if Q has 5 factors, then Q must be the product of two prime numbers (III). For example, if Q = p * q, where p and q are prime numbers, then the factors of Q are 1, p, q, p * q, and p * q.
                 Therefore, Q must be the square of a prime number (I) and the product of two prime numbers (III).

To solve this problem, let's denote the digit in the ten's place as x. Since the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, the digit at the unit's place is 2x. The two-digit number can be expressed as 10x + 2x = 12x. The sum of the digits is x + 2x = 3x. According to the problem, the two-digit number exceeds the sum of the digits by 18, so we can set up the equation 12x = 3x + 18. Subtracting 3x from both sides of the equation gives us 9x = 18. Dividing both sides of the equation by 9 gives us x = 2. Since the digit at the unit's place is 2x, the digit at the unit's place is 4. Therefore, the two-digit number is 12x = 12(2) = 24.

To find the time when the two trains will meet each other, we need to calculate the time taken by each train to cover the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow, and then find the time when they will meet each other.

                 The time taken by train ‘A’ to cover the distance x km at a speed of 40 kmph is x/40 hours.
                 The time taken by train ‘B’ to cover the distance x km at a speed of 72 kmph is x/72 hours.

To find the cost price (CP) of the book, we can use the formula: CP = Selling Price (SP) / (1 + (Profit Percentage / 100)).
                 Given that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a profit of 10%, we can calculate the CP as follows:
                 CP = 27.50 / (1 + (10 / 100))
                 CP = 27.50 / 1.1
                 CP = 25.00
                 Now, if the book were sold for Rs 25.75, we can calculate the percentage of profit and loss as follows:
                 Profit = SP - CP
                 Profit = 25.75 - 25.00
                 Profit = 0.75
                 Loss = CP - SP
                 Loss = 25.00 - 25.75
                 Loss = -0.75
                 Percentage of Profit = (Profit / CP) * 100
                 Percentage of Profit = (0.75 / 25.00) * 100
                 Percentage of Profit = 3%
                 Percentage of Loss = (Loss / CP) * 100
                 Percentage of Loss = (-0.75 / 25.00)

To find the total profit the grocery makes from selling 500 bags of ice, we first need to calculate the cost price of one bag of ice. Since the grocery makes a 20% profit, the selling price of one bag of ice is 20% more than the cost price.
                 Let's assume the cost price of one bag of ice is $x. Then, the selling price of one bag of ice is $x + 20% of $x, which is $x + 0.20x = $1.20x.
                 Since the selling price of one bag of ice is $1.25, we can set up the equation $1.20x = $1.25 and solve for x.
                 Dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20, we get x = $1.25 / 1.20 = $1.0417.
                 Now that we know the cost price of one bag of ice is $1.0417, we can calculate the total cost of 500 bags of ice, which is 500 * $1.0417 = $52.085.
                 The total revenue from selling 500 bags of ice is 500 * $1.25

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work and time. We know that P can finish the jar in 10 minutes if he eats alone, and Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes if she eats alone. Since they are eating simultaneously, we need to find the combined rate at which they can finish the jar.
Let's analyze the situation:
*   P can finish the jar in 10 minutes, so his rate is 1/10 of the jar per minute.
*   Q can finish half the jar in 5 minutes, so her rate is 1/5 of the jar per minute.
Since they are eating simultaneously, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates:
Combined rate = P's rate + Q's rate
= 1/10 + 1/5
= 1/10 + 2/10
= 3/10 of the jar per minute.
To find the time it takes to empty the jar, we can divide 1 (the whole jar) by their combined rate:
Time = 1 / (3/10)
= 10/3
= 3.33 minutes (approximately)
Since the answer choices are in whole numbers, we can round up to the nearest

To find the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere which will fit inside the cube, we need to consider the formulas for the volumes of a cube and a sphere. The volume of a cube is given by V_cube = s^3, where s is the length of the side of the cube. The volume of a sphere is given by V_sphere = (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.
                 Since the sphere will fit inside the cube, the diameter of the sphere will be equal to the side length of the cube, i.e., d = s. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is r = s/2.
                 Substituting the value of r in the formula for the volume of the sphere, we get V_sphere = (4/3)π(s/2)^3 = (1/6)πs^3.
                 Now, we can find the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere by dividing the volume of the cube by the volume of the sphere: V_cube / V_sphere = s^3 / ((1/6)πs^3) = 6/π.
                 Therefore, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to

To solve this problem, let's denote the distance from Winson's home to his school as "d" miles. The time it takes for Winson to run from his home to his school is d/10 hours, and the time it takes for him to walk back home is d/5 hours. Since the whole journey took one hour, we can set up the following equation:
d/10 + d/5 = 1
To solve for "d", we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10 to eliminate the fractions:
d + 2d = 10
Combine like terms:
3d = 10
Divide both sides by 3:
d = 10/3
d = 3.33
Since the answer choices are all whole numbers, we can round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3. Therefore, the distance from Winson's home to his school is approximately 3 miles. The correct answer is (D) 3.<|eot_id|>

To find the percent by which the average cost per year of the new tires is greater than the cost of repairing the current tires, we must first find the average cost per year of the new tires and the average cost per year of repairing the current tires. The average cost per year of the new tires is $180 divided by 4 years, which is $45 per year. The average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $40 divided by 1 year, which is $40 per year. To find the percent by which the average cost per year of the new tires is greater than the average cost per year of repairing the current tires, we must divide the difference between the average cost per year of the new tires and the average cost per year of repairing the current tires by the average cost per year of repairing the current tires and multiply by 100. The difference between the average cost per year of the new tires and the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is $45 minus $40, which is $5.

To find the rate of interest, we need to calculate the difference between the compound interest (C.I.) and simple interest (S.I.) for Rs.5000 for 2 years, which is given as Rs.72.
                 First, let's calculate the simple interest. The formula for simple interest is: S.I. = (P * R * T) / 100, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period in years.
                 We are given that the principal amount (P) is Rs.5000, the time period (T) is 2 years, and the difference between C.I. and S.I. is Rs.72. We need to find the rate of interest (R).
                 Let's assume the rate of interest is x%. Then, the simple interest is (5000 * x * 2) / 100 = 100x.
                 Now, let's calculate the compound interest. The formula for compound interest is: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time

To determine the number of senators that Hoopsmot can influence, we need to find the ratio of Hoopsmot's contribution to the total contribution. Hoopsmot's contribution is $16,000, and the total contribution is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000. The ratio of Hoopsmot's contribution to the total contribution is $16,000/$20,000 = 0.8. This means that Hoopsmot's contribution is 80% of the total contribution. To find the number of senators that Hoopsmot can influence, we multiply the total number of senators that they can influence (30) by the ratio of Hoopsmot's contribution (0.8). 30 x 0.8 = 24. Therefore, Hoopsmot can influence 24 senators. The correct answer is (D) 24.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many flowers the bee will fly by to bypass 8 flowers, we need to first determine how many flowers the bee will fly by in total before bypassing 8 flowers. Since the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of flowers the bee will fly by.
                 Let x be the total number of flowers the bee will fly by. Since the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers, the number of flowers the bee will bypass is 0.05% of x, or 0.0005x. We know that the bee will bypass 8 flowers, so we can set up the equation:
                 0.0005x = 8
                 To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.0005:
                 x = 8 / 0.0005
                 x = 16000
                 Therefore, the bee will fly by 16000 flowers to bypass 8 flowers. The correct answer is (D) 16000.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. The total number of ways to select 2 balls from n balls is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2. However, we are told that the ball with number 3 is not selected, so we need to find the number of ways to select 2 balls from n-1 balls. This is given by the combination formula C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2. Since there are 45 different ways to select 2 balls such that the ball with number 3 is not selected, we can set up the equation: (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Expanding the left-hand side, we get: n^2 - 3n + 2 = 90. Rearranging the equation, we get: n^2 - 3n - 88 = 0. Factoring the quadratic equation, we get: (n - 11)(n + 8) = 0. Solving for n, we get

To find the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the original rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(length + breadth). Substituting the given values, we get P = 2(27 + 17) = 2(44) = 88 cm. Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be equal to the length of the wire, which is 88 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a square is P = 4s, where s is the length of each side. Setting up the equation 88 = 4s, we can solve for s. Dividing both sides by 4, we get s = 88/4 = 22 cm. Therefore, the measure of each side of the square formed by rebending the wire is 22 cm. The correct answer is (C) 22.<|eot_id|>

Meenu said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight." This means that Meenu's weight is equal to 29 Kgs plus half of Meenu's weight. Let's say Meenu's weight is x. Then, Meenu's weight is equal to 29 Kgs plus half of Meenu's weight, which is x/2. So, we can write an equation: x = 29 + x/2. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2, which gives us 2x = 58 + x. Then, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 58. Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs. The correct answer is (D) 58.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many sales the sales person must make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we need to calculate the total amount of money he will earn from the sales. Since he gets a 10% commission on each sale, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let x be the number of sales he makes. Then, the total amount of money he will earn from the sales is 0.10x * 250 = 25x. Since he wants to earn at least $1000, we can set up the inequality 25x ≥ 1000. To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 25, which gives us x ≥ 40. Therefore, the sales person must make at least 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000. The correct answer is (D) 40.<|eot_id|>

To find the value of k, we can use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers. Since the least integer is -50 and the sum is 51, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. The sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 can be written as: (-50) + (-49) + (-48) +... + (-50 + k - 1). This is an arithmetic series with a common difference of -1. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: Sum = (n/2)(a + l), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. In this case, the first term is -50, and the last term is -50 + k - 1. Since the sum is 51, we can set up the equation: 51 = (k/2)(-50 + (-50 + k - 1)). Simplifying the equation, we get: 51 = (k/2)(-100 + k - 1). 51 = (k/2)(-101 + k). Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 102 = k(-101 + k). Expanding the

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.
Step 1:  We know that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. Let's assume Ajay's age 10 years back was x. Then, Sachin's age 10 years back would be 2x.
Step 2:  Since Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, his current age is 40 - 10 = 30 years.
Step 3:  We know that Sachin's age 10 years back was 30 - 10 = 20 years. Since Sachin's age 10 years back was 2x, we can set up the equation 2x = 20.
Step 4:  Solving the equation 2x = 20, we find that x = 10. This means that Ajay's age 10 years back was 10 years.
Step 5:  To find Ajay's current age, we add 10 years to his age 10 years back. Therefore, Ajay's current age is 10 + 10 = 20 years.

To find the area of the remaining paper after the semi-circles are cut down, we first need to calculate the area of the original square and then subtract the combined area of the two semi-circles.
The area of the square is found by squaring the length of its side: 20 cm * 20 cm = 400 square cm.
Next, we calculate the area of one semi-circle. The formula for the area of a semi-circle is (1/2) * π * r^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter of the semi-circle is 20 cm, the radius is half of that, which is 10 cm. So, the area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * π * (10 cm)^2 = (1/2) * π * 100 cm^2 = 50π cm^2.
Since there are two semi-circles, we multiply the area of one semi-circle by 2 to get the combined area: 2 * 50π cm^2 = 100π cm^2.
Now, we subtract the combined area of the semi-circles from the area of the square to find the area of the remaining paper: 400 square cm - 100π cm

To find the number of matches that the team lost, we need to calculate 30% of the total number of matches. The team won 20 matches, so the total number of matches is 20 / 0.7 = 28.7. To find 30% of 28.7, we multiply 28.7 by 0.3. 28.7 * 0.3 = 8.61. Since we can't have a fraction of a match, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 8. Therefore, the team lost 8 matches. The correct answer is (D) 7.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we need to calculate the amount of each vitamin that is contained in one gram of the health food. One gram of the health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. This means that one gram of the health food contains 0.09 times the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 0.08 times the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. To determine how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to divide the minimum daily requirement of each vitamin by the amount of each vitamin that is contained in one gram of the health food. The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is represented by the variable E, and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is represented by the variable A. The amount of vitamin E contained in one gram of the health food is 0.09E, and the amount of vitamin A contained in one gram of the health food is 0.08A.

To calculate the percentage gain, first, we need to find the cost price (CP) and selling price (SP) of the oranges. The merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so the cost price (CP) is Rs. 450. The merchant sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg, so the selling price (SP) is 90 * 7.50 = Rs. 675. Now, to find the percentage gain, we use the formula: (SP - CP) / CP * 100. Substituting the values, we get (675 - 450) / 450 * 100 = 225 / 450 * 100 = 0.5 * 100 = 50 %. Therefore, the merchant's percentage gain is 50 %. The correct answer is (A) 50 %.<|eot_id|>

To find the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books, we need to find the smallest number of unique codes that can represent 10 different types of books. Since each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters, we need to find the smallest number of unique codes that can represent 10 different types of books.
                 We can start by assuming that each type of book is represented by a single letter. In this case, we would need 10 unique letters to represent the 10 different types of books. However, this would not be the most efficient way to represent the books, as there are only 26 letters in the alphabet.
                 A more efficient way to represent the books would be to use pairs of letters. Since the order of letters in a pair does not matter, we can represent each type of book with a unique pair of letters. For example, we could use the pairs AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AJ, and AK to represent the 10 different types of books.

To find the area of the rectangular sheet, let's denote the length of the sheet as "L" and the width as "W". When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. This means that 2L + 2W = 48. When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. This means that 2W + 2L = 66.
                 We can simplify these equations by dividing both sides of each equation by 2. This gives us L + W = 24 and L + W = 33.
                 Since both equations are equal to L + W, we can set them equal to each other: L + W = 24 and L + W = 33. This means that 24 = 33, which is not true. However, we can add the two equations together to get 2L + 2W = 57. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 gives us L + W = 28.5.
                 Now we have two equations: L + W = 28.5 and L + W = 24. Since both equations are equal to L + W, we can set them equal

To find the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum, we first need to determine the volume of the original coin made of the alloy of aluminum and silver. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. Since the diameter of the original coin is 15 mm, the radius is half of that, which is 7.5 mm. The height of the coin is 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the original coin is V = π(7.5)^2(2) = 176.71 mm^3. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, the volume of aluminum is also 176.71 mm^3. Given that the weight of the original coin is 30 grams and silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of aluminum in the original coin is 30 grams / 3 = 10 grams. Since the volume of aluminum is 176.71 mm^3, the density of aluminum is 10 grams / 176.71 mm^3 = 0.0567 g/mm^3. Now, we can find the volume of the new coin made of pure aluminum

To find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots, we need to consider the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is given by the formula b2 - 4ac, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, a = 1, b = -5, and c = k.
                 The quadratic equation will have two real and distinct roots if the discriminant is greater than zero. So, we set up the inequality b2 - 4ac > 0 and substitute the values of a, b, and c.
                 (-5)2 - 4(1)(k) > 0
                 25 - 4k > 0

To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to calculate the permutations for each part and then multiply them together.
First, let's consider the letters. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet, and we need to choose 2 distinct letters. This can be done in 26P2 ways, which is equal to 26! / (26-2)! = 26! / 24! = 26 * 25 = 650.
Next, let's consider the numbers. There are 10 digits (0-9), and we need to choose 2 distinct numbers. This can be done in 10P2 ways, which is equal to 10! / (10-2)! = 10! / 8! = 10 * 9 = 90.
Since the letters and numbers are independent, we can multiply the number of permutations for each part to get the total number of distinct bike numbers. Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers is 650 * 90 = 58500.
However, this is not among the answer choices. Let's re-examine the problem. We are asked to find the number of letters that need to

To find the other integer, we can use the relationship between the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The product of the GCF and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves. Mathematically, this can be expressed as: GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. Given that the GCF is 11, the LCM is 7700, and one of the integers is 350, we can substitute these values into the equation: 11 * 7700 = 350 * b. Solving for b, we get: 84700 = 350b.

To determine how many days it will take Mr.Blue to complete the contract, we first need to find out how much work has been done by Mr.Brown and Mr.Black. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so in 8 days, he completes 8/6 = 4/3 of a house. Mr.Black can paint a house in 8 days, so in 6 days, he completes 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. Together, Mr.Brown and Mr.Black complete 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 of a house in 8 days. The remaining work is 1 - 25/12 = 7/12 of a house. Since Mr.Blue can paint a house in 12 days, he can complete 7/12 of a house in 7/12 * 12 = 7 days. Therefore, it will take Mr.Blue 7 days to complete the contract. The correct answer is (A) 7.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many minutes it will take to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour, we first need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 12 miles per hour by 60 minutes per hour to get the speed in miles per minute.
                 12 miles/hour ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 0.2 miles/minute
                 Now that we know the speed in miles per minute, we can divide the distance (48 miles) by the speed (0.2 miles/minute) to find the time it will take to travel 48 miles.
                 48 miles ÷ 0.2 miles/minute = 240 minutes
                 Therefore, it will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles at 12 miles per hour. The correct answer is (B) 240.<|eot_id|>

To find the time when the two trains cross each other, we need to calculate the time difference between their departure and arrival times.
                 Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it travels for 4 hours.
                 Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it travels for 3 hours and 30 minutes.
                 To find the time when they cross each other, we need to find the time when both trains have traveled for the same amount of time.
                 Since Train M travels for 4 hours and Train N travels for 3 hours and 30 minutes, we need to find the time when Train M has traveled for 3 hours and 30 minutes.
                 Since Train M leaves City A at 5 am, we add 3 hours and 30 minutes to 5 am.
                 5 am + 3 hours = 8 am
                 8 am + 30 minutes = 8:30 am
                 Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 8:30 am.

To find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The ratio of the height of the pole to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow. Let's denote the height of the tree as 'h'. We can set up the proportion as follows: 14/10 = h/15. To solve for 'h', we can cross-multiply: 14 * 15 = 10 * h. This simplifies to 210 = 10h. Dividing both sides by 10, we get h = 21. Therefore, the height of the tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions is 21 metres. The correct answer is (A) 21.<|eot_id|>

To find the total deer population in the forest, we can use the proportion of tagged deer in the sample to estimate the proportion of the total deer population that had tags in 2002. Since 20 out of 500 deer in the sample had tags, the proportion of tagged deer in the sample is 20/500 = 0.04. This proportion is assumed to be representative of the proportion of the total deer population that had tags in 2002. Since 300 deer were tagged in 2001, the proportion of the total deer population that had tags in 2002 is 300/(total deer population) = 0.04. Solving for the total deer population, we have 300/(total deer population) = 0.04, so total deer population = 300/0.04 = 7500. Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500. The correct answer is (E) 7500.<|eot_id|>

To find the original price of the item, let's denote the original price of the item as x. The item is discounted by 22%, so the price the customer pays is 78% of the original price, which is 0.78x. The customer also uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price the customer pays is 0.78x - 20. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, so we can set up the equation 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90. Solving for x, we have 0.78x - 0.5x = 1.90 + 20, which simplifies to 0.28x = 21.90. Dividing both sides by 0.28, we get x = 78.20. Therefore, the original price of the item is $78.20.

To find the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur, we need to find the probability of the complement of the union of the two events. The probability of the complement of the union of the two events is equal to 1 minus the probability of the union of the two events. The probability of the union of the two events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the two events minus the probability of the intersection of the two events. The probability of the intersection of the two events is equal to the product of the probabilities of the two events. Therefore, the probability of the complement of the union of the two events is equal to 1 minus the sum of the probabilities of the two events plus the product of the probabilities of the two events. Substituting the given values, we get: 1 - (0.56 + 0.74) + (0.56 * 0.74) = 1 - 1.30 + 0.4136 = 0.4136.

To find the man's new expenditure after his income increases by 20%, we first need to calculate his new income. Since his income increases by 20%, his new income will be 120% of his original income.
                 Let's assume his original income is $100. His original expenditure is 70% of $100, which is 0.7 * $100 = $70.
                 His new income will be 120% of $100, which is 1.2 * $100 = $120.
                 His new expenditure will be 70% of his new income, which is 0.7 * $120 = $84.
                 To find the percentage of his new expenditure, we divide his new expenditure by his new income and multiply by 100. This gives us ($84 / $120) * 100 = 70%.

To find the percentage by which the price should be increased to make it 100% after a 30% reduction, we can use the following steps:
Step 1: Calculate the price after the 30% reduction.
Let's assume the original price of the product is $100. After a 30% reduction, the price becomes:
$100 - (30% of $100) = $100 - $30 = $70
Step 2: Calculate the percentage increase needed to make the price $100.
To find the percentage increase, we can use the formula:
Percentage increase = ((New price - Original price) / Original price) x 100
Substituting the values, we get:
Percentage increase = (($100 - $70) / $70) x 100
= ($30 / $70) x 100
= 0.4286 x 100
= 42.86%
Therefore, the price should be increased by 42.86% to make it 100% after a 30% reduction. The correct answer is (B) 42.86%.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of employees in the organization, let's denote the number of employees as 'n'. Let's assume the contribution of each employee is 'x'. According to the problem, the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh, so we can set up the equation: n * x = 6,00,000. If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the new contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh, so we can set up another equation: n * (x + 60) = 6,24,000. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get: n * (x + 60) - n * x = 6,24,000 - 6,00,000. This simplifies to: n * 60 = 24,000. Dividing both sides by 60, we get: n = 24,000 / 60 = 400. Therefore, the number of employees in the organization is 400. The correct answer is (C) 400.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step. First, we know that 10 percent of the staplers produced were defective. This means that 90 percent of the staplers produced were non-defective. We are also given that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which means that 98 percent of the non-defective staplers were not rejected. We are told that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation 0.02x = 72, where x is the total number of non-defective staplers produced. Solving for x, we get x = 72 / 0.02 = 3600. This means that 3600 non-defective staplers were produced. Since 90 percent of the staplers produced were non-defective, we can set up the equation 0.9y = 3600, where y is the total number of staplers produced. Solving for y, we get y = 3600 / 0.9 = 4000. Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4000. The correct answer is (A) 4,000.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much speed the car gains, we first need to calculate the original distance the car traveled. We can do this by multiplying the original speed (60 km/hr) by the original time (20 hours).
                 Distance = Speed * Time
                 Distance = 60 km/hr * 20 hours
                 Distance = 1200 km
                 Now that we know the distance is 1200 km, we can calculate the new speed required to cover the same distance in 10 hours.
                 Speed = Distance / Time
                 Speed = 1200 km / 10 hours
                 Speed = 120 km/hr
                 To find out how much speed the car gains, we subtract the original speed (60 km/hr) from the new speed (120 km/hr).
                 Speed gained = New speed - Original speed
                 Speed gained = 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr
                 Speed gained = 60 km/hr
                 Therefore, the car gains 60 km/hr in speed when covering the same distance in 10 hours instead of 20 hours. The correct answer is (C) 120 kmph.<|eot_id|>

We know that the difference between the squares of the two numbers is 256000, so we can write the equation x^2 - y^2 = 256000. We also know that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so we can write the equation x + y = 1000.
                 We can factor the first equation as (x + y)(x - y) = 256000. Since we know that x + y = 1000, we can substitute this into the factored equation to get 1000(x - y) = 256000. Dividing both sides by 1000, we get x - y = 256.
                 Now we have two equations: x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256. We can add these two equations together to get 2x = 1256. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 628.
                 Substituting x = 628 into the equation x + y = 1000, we get 628 + y = 1000. Subtracting 628 from

To determine the cost of gardening a 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot, we first need to find the area of the plot. The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 metres. Since the boundary is 1-metre broad, we can assume that the width of the plot is 1 metre. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width. We can rearrange this formula to find the length of the plot: l = (P - 2w) / 2. Substituting the given values, we get l = (340 - 2(1)) / 2 = 338 / 2 = 169 metres. Now that we have the length and width, we can find the area of the plot using the formula A = l * w, where A is the area. Substituting the values, we get A = 169 * 1 = 169 square metres. Next, we need to find the area of the boundary. Since the boundary is 1-metre broad, we can find the area of the boundary by subtracting the area of the plot from the area of the larger

To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the unknown number as "x". According to the problem, the student found the value of 7/18 of the number, which is (7/18)x. The actual value of 7/8 of the number is (7/8)x. The difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is given as 770, so we can set up the following equation:
(7/18)x - (7/8)x = 770
To solve for x, we can first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 72. Then, we can rewrite the equation as:
(28/72)x - (63/72)x = 770
Combine like terms:
(-35/72)x = 770
Now, multiply both sides by -72/35 to solve for x:
x = 770 * (-72/35)
x = 1728
Therefore, the number is 1728. The correct answer is (C) 1728.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, let's denote Joe's age as J, his sister's age as S, and his father's age as F. We are given three pieces of information:
1. J + S + F = 100
2. When Joe is as old as his father (J = F), his sister will be twice as old as she is now (S = 2S).
3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father (F = 2(F - S)).
From the first equation, we can express S in terms of J and F: S = 100 - J - F.
Substituting J = F into the second equation, we get S = 2S, which simplifies to S = 0. However, this is not possible, so we need to re-examine our approach.
Let's re-evaluate the second equation. When Joe is as old as his father (J = F), his sister will be twice as old as she is now (S = 2S). This implies that S = 2S is not correct. Instead, we should consider the relationship between J, S, and

To find the value of M, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the maximum mark as M. According to the problem, when M is converted into 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks. This can be represented by the equation: (504 / M) * 800 = 420. To solve for M, we can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by M to get rid of the fraction: 504 * 800 = 420 * M. This simplifies to 403200 = 420 * M. Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 420 to isolate M: M = 403200 / 420. Calculating this, we get M = 960. Therefore, the value of M is 960. The correct answer is (E) 960.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of members in the club, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression (A.P.). The formula for the sum of n terms of an A.P. with first term 'a' and common difference 'd' is given by Sn = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]. In this case, the first term 'a' is 7 years, the common difference 'd' is 3 months or 0.25 years, and the sum of the ages of all the members 'S' is 250 years. Substituting these values into the formula, we get 250 = n/2 [2(7) + (n-1)(0.25)]. Simplifying the equation, we get 250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25n - 0.25]. Further simplifying, we get 250 = n/2 [13.75 + 0.25n]. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get 500 = n [13.75 + 0.25n]. Expanding the right-hand side, we get 500 = 13.75n + 0.25n^2. Rearranging the

To find the depth of the canal, we can use the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is A = 0.5 * (a + b) * h, where A is the area, a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides, and h is the height (or depth) of the trapezium. In this case, a = 10 m, b = 6 m, and A = 640 square meters. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for h.
                 640 = 0.5 * (10 + 6) * h
                 640 = 0.5 * 16 * h
                 640 = 8 * h

To solve this problem, we first need to find the original number from which 30 was subtracted to reduce it to one third. Let's call the original number x. We know that x - 30 = x/3. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get 3x - 90 = x. Then, we can subtract x from both sides to get 2x - 90 = 0. Adding 90 to both sides, we get 2x = 90. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 45. Now that we know the original number is 45, we can find 50% of that number by multiplying 45 by 0.5, which gives us 22.5. Therefore, the value of 50% of that number is 22.5. The correct answer is (A) 22.5.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), r is the annual interest rate (in decimal), n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year, and t is the time the money is invested for in years.
                 In this case, we know that A = $54,080, r = 8% or 0.08, n = 2 (since the interest is compounded semi-annually), and t = 1 year. We can plug these values into the formula and solve for P:
                 54,080 = P(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)
                 54,080 = P(1 + 0.04)^2

To find out how many hours it will take Shweta to cover 100 km, we first need to calculate how many 15 km segments are there in 100 km. 100 km divided by 15 km is 6 with a remainder of 10 km. This means that Shweta will cover 6 segments of 15 km and 10 km. Since she stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km segment, she will stop for a total of 6 x 10 minutes = 60 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour. Therefore, Shweta will take 6 hours to cover the 6 segments of 15 km and 1 hour to cover the remaining 10 km. So, the total time it will take Shweta to cover 100 km is 6 + 1 = 7 hours. The correct answer is (B) 10 hours. I made a mistake. The correct answer is (B) 10 hours. I made a mistake.

Let's denote the total number of students in the class as 'x'. We know that 8% of students are interested in Football, 4/5 of students are interested in Cricket, and 10% of students are interested in Basketball. We also know that 20 students are not interested in any games.
                 First, let's calculate the number of students interested in each game. The number of students interested in Football is 8% of 'x', which is 0.08x. The number of students interested in Cricket is 4/5 of 'x', which is 0.8x. The number of students interested in Basketball is 10% of 'x', which is 0.1x.
                 Now, let's add up the number of students interested in each game. The total number of students interested in games is 0.08x + 0.8x + 0.1x = 0.98x.
                 Since 20 students are not interested in any games, the total number of students in the class is the sum of students interested in games and students not interested in games. Therefore, the total number of students in the class is 0.98x + 20.

To find the difference between the maximum number of students and the minimum number of students, we first need to determine the total number of students. Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8, which are the denominators of the fractions given.
The LCM of 16, 10, and 8 is 80. This means that the total number of students must be a multiple of 80.
The smallest 4-digit multiple of 80 is 1280, and the largest 4-digit multiple of 80 is 9920.
To find the maximum number of students studying math, we multiply 1280 by 1/16, which gives us 80. To find the minimum number of students studying math, we multiply 9920 by 1/16, which gives us 620.
To find the maximum number of students studying bio, we multiply 1280 by 1/10, which gives us 128. To find the minimum number of students studying bio, we multiply 9920 by 1/10, which gives us 992.

To find the rate of interest per annum, we can use the simple interest formula: Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal (P) x Rate (R) x Time (T)) / 100. Given that the principal amount (P) is Rs. 5000, the time (T) is 3 years, and the simple interest (SI) is Rs. 300, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the rate (R): R = (SI x 100) / (P x T). Substituting the given values, we get R = (300 x 100) / (5000 x 3) = 30000 / 15000 = 2%. Therefore, the rate of interest per annum is 2%. The correct answer is (A) 2%.<|eot_id|>

To determine the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year, we need to calculate the percent change in population from one year ago to two years ago. If the population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years, then the population two years from now will be 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21 times the population of one year ago. Since the population two years from now is expected to be exactly double the population of one year ago, we can set up the equation 1.21P = 2P, where P is the population of one year ago. Solving for P, we get P = 1.21P / 2 = 0.605P. This means that the population two years ago was 60.5% of the population of one year ago. Therefore, the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is 100% - 60.5% = 39.5%, which is closest to 40%. The correct answer is (B) 40%.<|eot_id|>

To determine the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we must first calculate the total yearly production cost. Since the company produces 420 units per month, the total yearly production cost will be 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year * $110/unit = $552,000.
Next, we must calculate the total yearly revenue required to achieve a profit of at least $626,400. Since the total yearly production cost is $552,000, the total yearly revenue must be at least $552,000 + $626,400 = $1,178,400.
Since the company produces 420 units per month, the total yearly revenue must be at least $1,178,400 / 12 months/year = $98,200/month * 420 units/month = $41,040,000 / 420 units = $97,714.29 per unit.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $97,714.29, which is closest to answer choice (E) 280.<|eot_id|>

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of work and time. Let's assume that both Alex and Jacob have worked for x hours. Since Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, the number of toys Alex has made is x/7. Similarly, since Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, the number of toys Jacob has made is x/9. We are given that the total number of toys made by both of them is 35, so we can set up the equation: x/7 + x/9 = 35. To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 63 (the least common multiple of 7 and 9), which gives us: 9x + 7x = 2205. Combining like terms, we get 16x = 2205. Dividing both sides by 16, we get x = 137.5. Since x represents the number of hours worked, it must be a whole number. Therefore, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 138. Now that we know x, we can find the number of toys made by Jacob by dividing x by 9: 138/9 = 15.33.

To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we first need to determine the minimum number of students who attended the prom night and the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session.
                 The minimum number of students who attended the prom night is 45% of 200, which is 0.45 x 200 = 90 students.
                 The minimum number of students who took part in the debating session is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 x 200 = 70 students.
                 To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to subtract the sum of the minimum number of students who attended the prom night and the minimum number of students who took part in the debating session from the total number of students.
                 Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 200 - (90 + 70) = 200 - 160 = 40 students.

To find the bill for the month when 500 units are consumed, we first need to determine the fixed and variable parts of the bill.
Let's denote the fixed part of the bill as 'F' and the variable part as 'V'. We can set up two equations using the given information:
540F + 620V = 1800... (Equation 1)
500F + 620V = 2040... (Equation 2)
Now, we can solve these equations to find the values of 'F' and 'V'.
Multiplying Equation 1 by 500 and Equation 2 by 540, we get:
270000F + 310000V = 900000... (Equation 3)
270000F + 336200V = 1108800... (Equation 4)
Subtracting Equation 3 from Equation 4, we get:
26000V = 220800
V = 220800 / 26000
V = 8.46
Now that we have the value of 'V', we can substitute it into one of the original equations to find 'F'. Let's use Equation 1:

To find out how many months after B joined the business, C joined, we need to calculate the ratio of their investments multiplied by the number of months they invested. A invested Rs.40,000 for 12 months, B invested Rs.60,000 for 10 months, and C invested Rs.120,000 for x months. The ratio of their investments multiplied by the number of months they invested is 40,000 * 12 : 60,000 * 10 : 120,000 * x, which simplifies to 480,000 : 600,000 : 120,000x. Since C gets Rs.150,000 as his share of the total profit of Rs.375,000, the ratio of C's share to the total profit is 150,000 : 375,000, which simplifies to 2 : 5. We can set up the equation 480,000 / (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x) = 2 / 5 and solve for x. Cross-multiplying, we get 5 * 480,000 = 2 * (480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000x), which simplifies to

                 First, let's find the difference between 2272 and 875, which is 2272 - 875 = 1397. Since the remainders are the same, N must be a factor of 1397.
                 The prime factorization of 1397 is 1397 = 17 * 83. Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be a multiple of 17 or 83.
                 The smallest 3-digit multiple of 17 is 17 * 67 = 1149, and the smallest 3-digit multiple of 83 is 83 * 14 = 1162.
                 Since 1149 and 1162 have the same remainder when 2272 and 875 are divided by them, the sum of the digits of N is 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 = 15. However, 15 is not among the answer choices.
                 The next multiple of 17 is 17 * 68 = 1156, and the next multiple of 83 is

To find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B, we can use the concept of relative motion. Since the ants are moving towards each other, we can add their speeds to find their relative speed. The relative speed of ant A and ant B is 9 cm/h + 6 cm/h = 15 cm/h. Since the farms are 75 cm away from each other, we can divide the distance by the relative speed to find the time it takes for the ants to meet. Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 75 cm / 15 cm/h = 5 hours. Since ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/h, we can multiply the time by the speed to find the distance traveled by ant A. Distance = Speed x Time = 9 cm/h x 5 h = 45 cm. Therefore, the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B is 45 cm. The correct answer is (A) 45.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of marbles in the bag, we first need to determine the total number of black marbles in the bag. Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total number of black marbles. Let x be the total number of black marbles in the bag. We know that 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time was black, so we can set up the proportion: 1/20 = x/total marbles. We also know that 20 marbles were painted black and put back in the bag, so the total number of black marbles in the bag is x + 20. Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the proportion: 1/20 = (x + 20)/total marbles. Cross-multiplying, we get: total marbles = 20(x + 20). We also know that 20 marbles were pulled out the second time, so the total number of marbles pulled out is 20 + 20 = 40.

To determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse, we need to consider the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.
                 There are 5 horses in the race, and Mr. Jain selects 2 horses at random. The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated using the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, n = 5 and k = 2, so the total number of possible outcomes is C(5, 2) = 5! / (2!(5-2)!) = 10.
                 Now, let's consider the number of favorable outcomes. Since there is only one winning horse, there is only one favorable outcome.
                 Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 1/10 or 1/5.

To calculate the probability of the man catching the first train, we need to consider the time interval between the start of the harbor line and the start of the main line. The harbor line starts at 5:02 A.M. and the main line starts at 5:00 A.M. Therefore, the harbor line starts 2 minutes before the main line. Since the frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, the probability of the man catching the first train is the ratio of the time interval between the start of the harbor line and the start of the main line to the total time interval between the start of the harbor line and the start of the next train on the harbor line. The time interval between the start of the harbor line and the start of the next train on the harbor line is 10 minutes, and the time interval between the start of the harbor line and the start of the main line is 2 minutes.

To determine the number of ways to create the two groups, we can use the concept of combinations. Since the order of the groups does not matter, we can use the formula for combinations: C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in each group.
                 In this case, we have 10 lime soda bottles (n = 10) and we want to divide them into two groups of 5 members each (k = 5). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
                 C(10, 5) = 10! / (5!(10-5)!)
                 = 10! / (5!5!)
                 = (10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
                 = 252
                 Therefore, there are 252 ways to create the two groups of 5 members each from the 10 lime soda bottles.

To determine the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. The monthly salary S is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 and 5% of all monthly sales. Let's denote the monthly sales as x. Then, the equation can be written as: S = 500 + 0.05x. We want to find the value of x when S = $1500. Substituting S = $1500 into the equation, we get: 1500 = 500 + 0.05x. Subtracting 500 from both sides, we get: 1000 = 0.05x. Dividing both sides by 0.05, we get: x = 20000. Therefore, the monthly sales required for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500 is $20000. The correct answer is (D) $20000.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days, we first need to determine the work rate of the original group of x men working x hours per day. Since they can complete x units of work in x days, their work rate is x units / x days = 1 unit per day. This means that one man working one hour per day can complete 1/x units of work per day. Therefore, x men working x hours per day can complete x/x units of work per day, which simplifies to 1 unit of work per day. Now, we can calculate the work rate of y men working y hours per day. Since one man working one hour per day can complete 1/x units of work per day, y men working y hours per day can complete y/y units of work per day, which simplifies to 1/x units of work per day. Now that we know the work rate of y men working y hours per day, we can find out how much work they can complete in y days. Since their work rate is 1/x units of work per day, they can complete 1/x units of work per day * y days = y/x units of work in y days.
