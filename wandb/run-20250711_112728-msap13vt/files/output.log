To find out how many crackers each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers by the number of people. Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, the number of crackers each person got is the same as the number of cakes each person got.
                 First, we need to divide the total number of crackers (32) by the number of people (4).
                 32 ÷ 4 = 8
                 Therefore, each person ate 8 crackers.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese, we need to calculate the total hours spent on each language and then add them together.
Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English every day for 7 days, so the total hours spent on English is:
4 hours/day * 7 days = 28 hours
Ryan spends 5 hours on learning Chinese every day for 7 days, so the total hours spent on Chinese is:
5 hours/day * 7 days = 35 hours
To find the total hours spent on both languages, we add the hours spent on English and Chinese:
28 hours (English) + 35 hours (Chinese) = 63 hours
Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 63 hours on learning English and Chinese.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to subtract the number of orchids in the vase after she cut them from the original number of orchids. The original number of orchids was 3, and the number of orchids in the vase after she cut them is 7. So, the number of orchids she cut is 7 - 3 = 4. Therefore, Jessica cut 4 orchids from her flower garden.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give each house, we need to divide the total number of junk mail pieces by the total number of houses.
                 First, we need to find the total number of houses. Since there are 19 houses on a block and there are 78 blocks, the total number of houses is 19 * 78 = 1488.
                 Next, we divide the total number of junk mail pieces (38) by the total number of houses (1488).
                 38 ÷ 1488 = 0.0255
                 Therefore, the mailman should give approximately 0.0255 pieces of junk mail to each house. Since you can't give a fraction of a piece of junk mail, the mailman should give 1 piece of junk mail to each house.<|eot_id|>

Since you can't have a negative number of peaches, this means Jill has no peaches. Next, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. Since Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven and Steven has 4 peaches, we can find Jake's peaches by subtracting 12 from 4. 4 - 12 = -8. This means Jake has -8 peaches. Since you can't have a negative number of peaches, this means Jake has no peaches. Now that we know Jill has no peaches and Jake has no peaches, we can determine how many more peaches Jill has than Jake. Since Jill has no peaches and Jake has no peaches, Jill has 0 more peaches than Jake. The answer is 0.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many bags of cans Tiffany had altogether, we need to add the number of bags she had on Monday to the number of bags she found on the next day and the day after that.
                 Number of bags on Monday = 10
                 Number of bags found on the next day = 3
                 Number of bags found on the day after that = 7
                 Total number of bags = 10 + 3 + 7
                 Total number of bags = 20
                 Therefore, Tiffany had 20 bags of cans altogether.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of shelves in Adam's room, we need to divide the total number of action figures his room can hold (8) by the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf (10).
                 8 ÷ 10 = 0.8
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we round down to the nearest whole number.
                 0.8 ≈ 0.8
                 Therefore, Adam's room has approximately 0.8 shelves. However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we can conclude that Adam's room has 1 shelf.
                 Alternatively, we can multiply the total number of action figures his room can hold (8) by the reciprocal of the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf (1/10).
                 8 × (1/10) = 8 × 0.1 = 0.8
                 Therefore, Adam's room has approximately 0.8 shelves. However, since we can't have a fraction of a shelf, we can conclude that Adam's room has 1 shelf.

To find the total number of push-ups done by Zachary and David, we need to first find out how many push-ups Zachary did. Since David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary and David did 38 push-ups, we can set up the equation 38 = x + 56, where x is the number of push-ups Zachary did. Solving for x, we get x = 38 - 56 = -18. However, since the number of push-ups cannot be negative, this means that the initial assumption that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem. If David did 38 push-ups and he did 56 more than Zachary, then Zachary must have done 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups. Since the number of push-ups cannot be negative, this means that the initial assumption that David did 56 more push-ups than Zachary is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem. If David did 38 push-ups and he did 56 more than Zachary, then Zachary must have done 38 - 56 = -18 push-ups.

To find out how many candy bars Dan bought, we need to divide the amount of money he has ($ 2) by the cost of each candy bar ($ 3).

                 Since Dan can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, we round down to the nearest whole number.
                 0.67 ≈ 0
                 Therefore, Dan did not buy any candy bars.
                 However, if Dan had $ 3, he could buy one candy bar.

To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we first need to find out how many roses she cut from her garden. We know that there were originally 21 roses in the vase, and after throwing away 34 roses, there were 15 roses left in the vase. This means that 21 + 34 - 15 = 40 roses were either thrown away or cut from the garden. Since Jessica threw away 34 roses, she must have cut 40 - 34 = 6 roses from her garden. To find out how many more roses she threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to subtract the number of roses she cut from the number of roses she threw away. 34 - 6 = 28. Therefore, Jessica threw away 28 more roses than those she cut from her garden. The answer is 28.<|eot_id|>

                 Number of days = Number of bottles drank / Number of bottles drank per day
                 Number of days = 144 / 144

Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed 24 pounds. On the way back Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries. Marco's strawberries now weighed 3 pounds. To find out how much his dad's strawberries weighed, we need to subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight of the strawberries they collected. So, we subtract 3 pounds from 24 pounds. 24 - 3 = 21. Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 21 pounds.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many green peaches are in each basket, we first need to determine the total number of green peaches in both baskets. Since there are a total of 12 peaches and each basket has 4 red peaches, the total number of green peaches can be found by subtracting the total number of red peaches from the total number of peaches.
                 Total number of red peaches = 4 * 2 = 8
                 Total number of green peaches = Total number of peaches - Total number of red peaches
                 Total number of green peaches = 12 - 8
                 Total number of green peaches = 4
                 Since there are a total of 4 green peaches in both baskets, the number of green peaches in each basket can be found by dividing the total number of green peaches by 2.
                 Number of green peaches in each basket = Total number of green peaches / 2
                 Number of green peaches in each basket = 4 / 2
                 Number of green peaches in each basket = 2

Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples. Jake has 13 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 12 + 13 = 25 apples. Jake also has 17 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 8 - 17 = -9 peaches. Since you can't have a negative number of peaches, Jake must have 0 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 25 apples and 0 peaches. The answer is 25.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earns during the 216 weeks of harvest and then subtract the amount of tax he has to pay.
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the 216 weeks of harvest. To do this, we multiply the amount of money he earns per week ($21) by the number of weeks (216).
Total amount of money earned = $21 * 216
Total amount of money earned = $4536
Now, let's subtract the amount of tax he has to pay ($702) from the total amount of money earned.
Total amount of money at the end of the harvest season = Total amount of money earned - Tax
Total amount of money at the end of the harvest season = $4536 - $702
Total amount of money at the end of the harvest season = $3834
Therefore, Lewis will have $3834 at the end of the harvest season.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the total number of people. Since Matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by 28.
                 Total number of crackers = 13
                 Total number of cakes = 15
                 Total number of people = 28
                 Number of crackers each person ate = Total number of crackers / Total number of people
                 Number of crackers each person ate = 13 / 28
                 Number of crackers each person ate = 0.4643 (approximately)
                 Number of cakes each person ate = Total number of cakes / Total number of people
                 Number of cakes each person ate = 15 / 28
                 Number of cakes each person ate = 0.5357 (approximately)

To find the total number of marbles Josh has now, we need to add the marbles he found (13) to the marbles he already had (22), and then subtract the marbles he lost (5).
                 22 (initial marbles) + 13 (found marbles) = 35
                 35 - 5 (lost marbles) = 30
                 Therefore, Josh now has 30 marbles in his collection.<|eot_id|>

To find the difference between the number of cakes and pastries the baker made, we need to subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes.
                 Number of cakes = 84
                 Number of pastries = 52
                 Difference = Number of cakes - Number of pastries

To find out how many planks John needs for the house wall, we first need to find out how many nails were used to secure the planks. Since each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used, the total number of nails used to secure the planks is 3 x number of planks + 8. We know that the total number of nails used is 11. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3x + 8 = 11, where x is the number of planks. Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation, we get 3x = 3. Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we get x = 1. Therefore, John needs 1 plank for the house wall.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we need to add the amount he spent to the amount he received from his friend and then subtract that total from the amount he has now.
                 First, we add the amount he spent ($17) to the amount he received from his friend ($10). $17 + $10 = $27.
                 Then, we subtract the total amount ($27) from the amount he has now ($7). $27 - $7 = $20.
                 Therefore, Edward had $20 before he spent his money.<|eot_id|>

Jessica started with 2 roses in the vase. After throwing away 4 roses, she was left with 2 - 4 = -2 roses. Since you can't have a negative number of roses, she must have cut some new roses to replace the ones she threw away. To find out how many roses she cut, we need to add the number of roses she threw away to the total number of roses in the vase now. The number of roses she cut is 4 (the number of roses she threw away) + 23 (the total number of roses in the vase now) = 27. Therefore, Jessica cut 27 - 2 = 25 new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase. The answer is 25.<|eot_id|>

Then Ed had x + 19 marbles. Now Ed has 8 more marbles than Doug, which means Ed has x + 8 marbles. Since Ed lost some of his marbles, we can set up the equation x + 19 - y = x + 8, where y is the number of marbles Ed lost. Simplifying the equation, we get 19 - y = 8. Solving for y, we get y = 11.

                 Difference = 9 - 0
                 Difference = 9 cups
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour

To determine the number of buses needed, we need to calculate the total number of students in the school. Since there are 58 students in the school and each classroom has the same number of students, we can divide the total number of students by the number of classrooms to find the number of students in each classroom.
                 58 students / 87 classrooms = 0.66 students per classroom
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a student, we can round up to the nearest whole number to find the number of students in each classroom.
                 0.66 students per classroom ≈ 1 student per classroom
                 Now, we can multiply the number of students in each classroom by the number of classrooms to find the total number of students.
                 1 student per classroom * 87 classrooms = 87 students
                 Since there are 2 seats on each school bus, we can divide the total number of students by 2 to find the number of buses needed.
                 87 students / 2 seats per bus = 43.5 buses
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we can round up to the nearest whole number to find the number of buses needed.

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to subtract the number of birds from the number of storks.
                 Initially, there were 2 birds and 6 storks. Then, 3 more birds came to join them. So, the total number of birds is 2 + 3 = 5.
                 The number of storks remains the same, which is 6.
                 To find the difference, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 - 5 = 1.
                 Therefore, there is 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence.<|eot_id|>

Dan has $ 4. He bought 99 candy bars for $ 3 each. To find out how much money is left, we need to subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the amount of money Dan had initially. The total cost of the candy bars is 99 x $ 3 = $ 297. Subtracting this amount from Dan's initial $ 4, we get $ 4 - $ 297 = -$ 293. Since Dan can't have a negative amount of money, we know that he doesn't have enough money to buy 99 candy bars at $ 3 each.

                 Total number of red peaches = Number of red peaches per basket * Number of baskets
                 Total number of red peaches = 19 * 15
                 Total number of red peaches = 285
                 Total number of green peaches = Number of green peaches per basket * Number of baskets
                 Total number of green peaches = 4 * 15
                 Total number of green peaches = 60
                 Total number of peaches = Total number of red peaches + Total number of green peaches
                 Total number of peaches = 285 + 60
                 Total number of peaches = 345
                 Therefore, there are 345 peaches in the baskets altogether.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many children got on the bus at the bus stop, we need to subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the total number of children who were on the bus after some got on.
                 Initially, there were 21 children on the bus. At the bus stop, 10 children got off, leaving 21 - 10 = 11 children on the bus.
                 Then, some more children got on the bus. After that, there were 16 children altogether on the bus.
                 So, the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop can be found by subtracting the number of children who remained on the bus (11) from the total number of children on the bus after some got on (16).
                 Therefore, the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop is 16 - 11 = 5.
                 Hence, 5 children got on the bus at the bus stop.<|eot_id|>

                 12 cups (total flour) - 11 cups (flour already added) = 1 cup
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour to complete the recipe.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of seats on the Ferris wheel, we need to divide the total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time by the number of people that each seat can hold.
                 Given that 4 people can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time and each seat can hold 2 people, we can calculate the number of seats as follows:
                 Number of seats = Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel at the same time / Number of people that each seat can hold
                 Number of seats = 4 / 2
                 Number of seats = 2
                 Therefore, the Ferris wheel in paradise park has 2 seats.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we first need to determine the number of boys. Since there are 868 girls and 281 more girls than boys, we can calculate the number of boys by subtracting 281 from the number of girls.
                 Number of boys = Number of girls - 281
                 Number of boys = 868 - 281
                 Number of boys = 587
                 Now that we know the number of boys, we can find the total number of pupils by adding the number of girls and the number of boys.
                 Total number of pupils = Number of girls + Number of boys
                 Total number of pupils = 868 + 587
                 Total number of pupils = 1455
                 Therefore, there are 1455 pupils in the school.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many marbles Doug lost, we need to set up an equation. Let's say Doug had x marbles initially. Since Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, Ed had x + 2 marbles. After Doug lost some marbles, Ed had 19 more marbles than Doug. This can be represented by the equation (x + 2) - y = x - y + 19, where y is the number of marbles Doug lost. Simplifying the equation, we get x + 2 - y = x - y + 19. Subtracting x from both sides, we get 2 - y = -y + 19. Adding y to both sides, we get 2 = -y + 19. Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get -17 = -y. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get y = 17. Therefore, Doug lost 17 marbles.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much more money Olivia spent at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she spent at the supermarket and the amount she collected from the ATM.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of money Olivia had after collecting 91 dollars from the ATM:
                 Total money = Initial money + Money collected from ATM
                 Total money = 53 + 91
                 Total money = 144
                 Next, let's calculate the amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket:
                 Money spent at supermarket = Total money - Money left
                 Money spent at supermarket = 144 - 14
                 Money spent at supermarket = 130
                 Now, let's calculate the difference between the amount she spent at the supermarket and the amount she collected at the ATM:
                 Difference = Money spent at supermarket - Money collected from ATM
                 Difference = 130 - 91
                 Difference = 39
                 Therefore, Olivia spent 39 dollars more at the supermarket than she collected at the ATM.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game, we need to know how many t-shirts they sold during the Arkansas game. We are given that they sold 89 t-shirts during the Arkansas game. Since they make $ 98 dollars off each t-shirt sold, we can multiply the number of t-shirts sold during the Arkansas game by the amount of money they make per t-shirt to find the total amount of money they made during the Arkansas game.
                 89 t-shirts * $ 98 per t-shirt = $ 8,682
                 Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 8,682 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many baskets of peaches there are, we need to divide the total number of peaches by the number of peaches in each basket. Since each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + 3 = 7. If there are a total of 7 peaches in all baskets, we can divide 7 by 7 to find the number of baskets. 7 ÷ 7 = 1. Therefore, there is 1 basket of peaches.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of sacks of oranges they will have after 51 days of harvest, we need to calculate the total number of sacks harvested and then subtract the number of sacks discarded.
                 First, we calculate the total number of sacks harvested in 51 days: 74 sacks/day * 51 days = 3,774 sacks.
                 Next, we calculate the total number of sacks discarded in 51 days: 71 sacks/day * 51 days = 3,651 sacks.
                 Finally, we subtract the total number of sacks discarded from the total number of sacks harvested: 3,774 sacks - 3,651 sacks = 123 sacks.

To find out how many more tickets Dave used to buy toys than he did to buy clothes, we need to subtract the number of tickets he used to buy clothes from the number of tickets he used to buy toys.
                 Tickets used to buy toys = 12
                 Tickets used to buy clothes = 7
                 Difference = Tickets used to buy toys - Tickets used to buy clothes
                 Difference = 12 - 7
                 Difference = 5
                 Therefore, Dave used 5 more tickets to buy toys than he did to buy clothes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many apples Bob has, we first need to find out how many apples Adam and Jackie have together. We know that together they have 14 apples. We also know that Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie. Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then Adam has x + 4 apples. Since together they have 14 apples, we can set up the equation x + (x + 4) = 14. Solving for x, we get 2x + 4 = 14. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 10. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 5. So Jackie has 5 apples and Adam has 5 + 4 = 9 apples. Since Bob has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, Bob has 14 + 6 = 20 apples. Therefore, Bob has 20 apples.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought. However, we don't know how many books he sold. Let's call the number of books he sold "x". We know that Paul had 71 books initially and he bought 38 new ones, so the total number of books he has now is 71 + 38 = 109. Since he has 116 books now, he must have sold 116 - 109 = 7 books. To find out how many more books he bought than he sold, we need to subtract the number of books he sold from the number of books he bought, which is 38 - 7 = 31.

To determine how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we first need to find out how much the frog jumped. Since the frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, and the grasshopper jumped 14 inches, the frog jumped 37 + 14 = 51 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse jumped 51 - 16 = 35 inches. To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump, which is 35 - 14 = 21 inches.

To find out how many more pieces of candy than chocolate Bobby ate, we need to subtract the number of pieces of chocolate he ate from the number of pieces of candy he ate.
                 The number of pieces of candy he ate is 38 + 36 = 74.
                 The number of pieces of chocolate he ate is 16.
                 Subtracting the number of pieces of chocolate from the number of pieces of candy, we get 74 - 16 = 58.
                 Therefore, Bobby ate 58 more pieces of candy than chocolate.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats, we need to multiply the number of large seats by the number of people each large seat can hold.
                 Number of large seats = 7
                 Number of people each large seat can hold = 12
                 Total number of people that can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats = 7 * 12 = 84
                 Therefore, 84 people can ride the Ferris wheel on large seats.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of boys in the school, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students. First, we need to find the total number of students in the school. Since there are 228 more girls than boys, we can represent the number of boys as x and the number of girls as x + 228. We know that the number of girls is 697, so we can set up the equation x + 228 = 697. Solving for x, we get x = 469. Now that we know the number of boys, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of girls and the number of boys: 697 + 469 = 1166. Therefore, there are 469 boys in the school.<|eot_id|>

Since Doug lost 11 marbles, we can subtract 11 from 35 to find out how many marbles Doug had left. 35 - 11 = 24. Since Ed had 45 marbles and Doug had 24 marbles, we can subtract 24 from 45 to find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug. 45 - 24 = 21. Therefore, Ed had 21 more marbles than Doug.<|eot_id|>

                 308 - 231 = 77
                 Therefore, Paul gave 77 more crayons to his friends than those he lost.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of boys Haley gave marbles to, we need to divide the total number of marbles she had by the number of marbles she gave to each boy.
                 Total marbles = 28
                 Marbles given to each boy = 2
                 Number of boys = Total marbles / Marbles given to each boy
                 Number of boys = 28 / 2
                 Number of boys = 14

Since you can't have a negative weight, this means that Jessie must have weighed more than 101 kilograms before she started jogging. To find out how much she weighed before she started jogging, we need to add 101 kilograms to her current weight. 27 + 101 = 128 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie weighed 128 kilograms before she started jogging.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of balloons Allan and Jake had in the park, we need to add the number of balloons each of them brought and the number of balloons Allan bought at the park.
                Allan brought 3 balloons and bought 2 more, so he had a total of 3 + 2 = 5 balloons.
                Jake brought 5 balloons.
                So, the total number of balloons Allan and Jake had in the park is 5 (Allan's balloons) + 5 (Jake's balloons) = 10 balloons.
                Therefore, Allan and Jake had 10 balloons in the park.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt Mary needs to add, we need to find out how many cups of flour she needs to add and how many cups of salt she needs to add. Since the recipe calls for 7 cups of flour and she already put in 2 cups, she needs to add 7 - 2 = 5 more cups of flour. The recipe calls for 4 cups of salt, so she needs to add 4 more cups of salt. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of salt she needs to add, we need to subtract the number of cups of salt she needs to add from the number of cups of flour she needs to add. 5 - 4 = 1. Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of salt.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add, we first need to find out how many cups of flour she has already put in. Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up an equation. Let x be the number of cups of flour she has already put in. Then, the number of cups of flour she still needs is 6 - x. Since she needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, we can set up the equation 6 - x = 13 + 8. Solving for x, we get 6 - x = 21. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get -x = 15. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get x = -15. Since we can't have a negative number of cups of flour, this means that Mary has already put in 0 cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour she needs to add, we can subtract the number of cups of flour she has already put in from the total number of cups of flour the recipe calls for: 6 - 0 = 6. Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of flour

To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we first need to determine how many peaches and apples Jake has. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 3 = 9 peaches. Jake also has 10 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 15 + 10 = 25 apples. Now that we know Jake has 9 peaches and 25 apples, we can calculate how many more apples than peaches Steven has.

To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we first need to determine how many peaches and apples Jake has. Since Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, Jake has 17 - 6 = 11 peaches. Jake also has 8 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 16 + 8 = 24 apples. Now that we know Jake has 11 peaches and 24 apples, we can find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has by subtracting the number of apples from the number of peaches. Steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples, so 17 - 16 = 1. Therefore, Steven has 1 more peach than apple. The answer is 1.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of books and magazines Bryan has, we need to calculate the total number of books and the total number of magazines separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the total number of books. Since Bryan has 23 books in each of his 29 bookshelves, we can multiply the number of books per bookshelf by the number of bookshelves to get the total number of books.
Total number of books = Number of books per bookshelf x Number of bookshelves
Total number of books = 23 x 29
Total number of books = 667
Next, let's calculate the total number of magazines. Since Bryan has 61 magazines in each of his 29 bookshelves, we can multiply the number of magazines per bookshelf by the number of bookshelves to get the total number of magazines.
Total number of magazines = Number of magazines per bookshelf x Number of bookshelves
Total number of magazines = 61 x 29
Total number of magazines = 1769
Now, let's add the total number of books and the total number of magazines together to get the total number of books and magazines Bryan has.
Total number of books and magazines = Total number of books + Total number

To find out how many bags of cookies you have, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag. Since you have 28 cookies and each bag has an equal number of cookies, we can divide 28 by the number of cookies in each bag. However, we are not given the number of cookies in each bag. We are given the total number of bags, which is 14, and the total number of items, which is 28 cookies + 86 candies = 114 items. To find the number of cookies in each bag, we can divide the total number of items by the total number of bags: 114 items / 14 bags = 8.14 items per bag. Since we can't have a fraction of a cookie, we can assume that each bag has 8 cookies. Now that we know the number of cookies in each bag, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag to find out how many bags of cookies you have: 28 cookies / 8 cookies per bag = 3.5 bags. Since we can't have a fraction of a bag, we can assume that you have 3 bags of cookies and 1 bag with 8 cookies

To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we need to subtract the number of children who got off the bus from the number of children who got on the bus. However, we don't know the exact number of children who got on the bus. Let's call the number of children who got on the bus "x". We know that initially, there were 5 children on the bus. After 63 children got off, there were 5 - 63 = -58 children on the bus. Since we can't have a negative number of children, this means that the number of children who got on the bus must be greater than 63. We also know that after some children got on the bus, there were 14 children altogether on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation x - 63 = 14, where x is the number of children who got on the bus. Solving for x, we get x = 77. This means that 77 children got on the bus. To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we subtract the number of children who got off from the number of children who got on the bus: 77 - 63 =

To find out how many cakes the baker would still have, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he had initially, and then add the number of new cakes he made.
                 Initially, the baker had 110 cakes. He sold 75 of them, leaving him with 110 - 75 = 35 cakes.
                 Then, he made 76 more cakes. So, the total number of cakes he would still have is 35 + 76 = 111 cakes.
                 Therefore, the baker would still have 111 cakes.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more apps Dave added than he deleted, we need to subtract the number of apps he deleted from the number of apps he added. First, we need to find out how many apps he deleted. To do this, we can subtract the number of apps he had left (24) from the number of apps he had after adding the new apps (21 + 89 = 110). 110 - 24 = 86. Therefore, Dave deleted 86 apps. To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we can subtract the number of apps he deleted (86) from the number of apps he added (89). 89 - 86 = 3. Therefore, Dave added 3 more apps than he deleted. The answer is 3.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of visitors to the Buckingham palace within the past 89 days, we need to add up the number of visitors for each of the 89 days. However, we are given the number of visitors for only 3 days. To find the number of visitors for the remaining 86 days, we can assume that the number of visitors for each day is the same as the number of visitors for the previous day.
                 Therefore, we can calculate the number of visitors for the remaining 86 days by multiplying the number of visitors for the third day (808) by 86.
                 The total number of visitors for the 3 days is 512 + 471 + 808 = 1791.
                 The total number of visitors for the remaining 86 days is 808 * 86 = 69,688.

To find out how much farther until they reach the end of the cave, we need to subtract the current depth (849 feet) from the total depth of the cave (1218 feet).
                 1218 - 849 = 369
                 Therefore, they are 369 feet away from reaching the end of the cave.
                 Since they are traveling at a speed of 17 feet per minute, we can calculate the time it will take to reach the end of the cave by dividing the distance by the speed.
                 369 feet / 17 feet per minute = 21.59 minutes

To determine the number of buses needed, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus.
                 Total number of students = 111
                 Number of seats on each bus = 3
                 Number of buses needed = Total number of students / Number of seats on each bus
                 Number of buses needed = 111 / 3
                 Number of buses needed = 37
                 Since we can't have a fraction of a bus, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
                 Number of buses needed = 38
                 Therefore, 38 buses are needed to take the trip.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to find the difference between the number of storks and the number of birds.
                 First, let's count the number of birds. There were 3 birds initially, and 2 more birds came to join them. So, the total number of birds is 3 + 2 = 5.
                 Next, let's count the number of storks. There were 6 storks that came to join the birds. So, the total number of storks is 6.
                 To find the difference between the number of storks and the number of birds, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 6 - 5 = 1.
                 Therefore, there is 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence.<|eot_id|>

The amount of money he had left was $ 3. Subtracting $ 3 from $ 4 will give us the cost of the candy bar. $ 4 - $ 3 = $ 1. Therefore, the candy bar cost $ 1.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of kids that stay home, we need to subtract the number of kids that go to camp from the total number of kids.
                 Total number of kids = 898051
                 Number of kids that go to camp = 629424
                 Number of kids that stay home = Total number of kids - Number of kids that go to camp
                 Number of kids that stay home = 898051 - 629424
                 Number of kids that stay home = 268627

To determine the total number of nails needed, we need to calculate the number of nails required for the large planks and the small planks separately and then add them together.
                 First, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. There are 12 large planks, and each requires 15 nails. So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is 12 x 15 = 180.
                 Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the small planks. There are 10 small planks, and each requires 5 nails. So, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is 10 x 5 = 50.
                 Finally, we add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks together to get the total number of nails needed for the house wall. 180 + 50 = 230.
                 Therefore, John needs 230 nails for the house wall.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many minutes the machine worked today, we need to first find out how many shirts it made today. Since the machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today, it made a total of 9 + 8 = 17 shirts today. Since the machine can make 2 shirts a minute, we can divide the total number of shirts it made today (17) by the number of shirts it can make per minute (2). 17 ÷ 2 = 8.5 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 8.5 minutes today.<|eot_id|>

To find the depth of the water, we first need to determine Dean's height. Since Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, and Ron is 14 feet tall, we can calculate Dean's height by subtracting 8 feet from Ron's height.
                 Dean's height = Ron's height - 8 feet
                 Dean's height = 14 feet - 8 feet
                 Dean's height = 6 feet
                 Now that we know Dean's height, we can calculate the depth of the water. The depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height.
                 Depth of the water = 2 * Dean's height
                 Depth of the water = 2 * 6 feet
                 Depth of the water = 12 feet

To determine how many more cakes the baker made than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the initial number of cakes.
                 Initial number of cakes = 40
                 Number of cakes sold = 8
                 Number of cakes made = Initial number of cakes - Number of cakes sold
                 Number of cakes made = 40 - 8
                 Number of cakes made = 32
                 Number of cakes made more than those sold = Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold
                 Number of cakes made more than those sold = 32 - 8
                 Number of cakes made more than those sold = 24
                 Therefore, the baker made 24 more cakes than those he sold.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Lewis earns during harvest season, we need to calculate his total earnings for the 1091 weeks of harvest. Since he earns $28 per week for regular work and $939 per week for overtime, we can multiply the number of weeks by the weekly earnings for each type of work.
                 Total earnings for regular work = 1091 weeks * $28/week = $30,608
                 Total earnings for overtime work = 1091 weeks * $939/week = $1,021,109
                 Total earnings during harvest season = Total earnings for regular work + Total earnings for overtime work
                 Total earnings during harvest season = $30,608 + $1,021,109
                 Total earnings during harvest season = $1,051,717

To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to know how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the frog. We know that the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Since the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, the frog jumped 19 - 4 = 15 inches. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so the mouse jumped 15 - 44 = -29 inches. Since we can't have a negative number of inches, this means that the mouse jumped 29 inches less than the frog, not 44 inches less. Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches and the mouse jumped 15 - 29 = -14 inches. Since we can't have a negative number of inches, this means that the mouse jumped 29 inches less than the frog, not 44 inches less. Therefore, the frog jumped 15 inches and the mouse jumped 15 - 29 = -14 inches.

To find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey, we need to find the difference between the cost of a t-shirt and the cost of a jersey. We can do this by subtracting the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt.
                 The cost of a t-shirt is $192 and the cost of a jersey is $34. Subtracting the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt, we get $192 - $34 = $158.
                 Therefore, a t-shirt costs $158 more than a jersey.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many crayons Paul got for his birthday, we need to add the number of crayons he had left to the number of crayons he lost or gave away. This is because the number of crayons he had left is the result of subtracting the number of crayons he lost or gave away from the total number of crayons he originally had.
                 Let x be the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday. We know that x - 551 = 177. To solve for x, we need to add 551 to both sides of the equation. This gives us x = 177 + 551. Solving for x, we get x = 728. Therefore, Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday.
                 Alternatively, we can also solve this problem by adding the number of crayons he had left to the number of crayons he lost or gave away. This gives us x = 177 + 551 = 728. Therefore, Paul got 728 crayons for his birthday.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more marbles Josh lost than those he found, we need to subtract the number of marbles he found from the number of marbles he lost.
                 Number of marbles lost = 16
                 Number of marbles found = 8
                 Difference = Number of marbles lost - Number of marbles found
                 Difference = 16 - 8
                 Difference = 8

To find out how much Jessie weighed before she started jogging, we need to subtract the total amount of weight she lost from her current weight. Jessie lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week. The total weight she lost is 62 + 140 = 202 kilograms. Her current weight is 9 kilograms. Subtracting the total weight she lost from her current weight, we get 9 - 202 = -193 kilograms. Since we can't have a negative weight, this means that Jessie must have weighed more than 193 kilograms before she started jogging. To find out how much she weighed before she started jogging, we need to add the total weight she lost to her current weight. 9 + 202 = 211 kilograms. Therefore, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms before she started jogging.<|eot_id|>

                 First, we need to find out how many children got off the bus. We know that there were 30 children on the bus after some got off. We also know that there were 28 children on the bus initially and 82 children got on the bus.
                 So, the number of children that got on the bus is 82. The number of children that got off the bus can be found by subtracting the number of children on the bus after some got off (30) from the number of children on the bus initially (28) plus the number of children that got on the bus (82).
                 So, the number of children that got off the bus is 28 + 82 - 30 = 80.
                 To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we subtract the number of children that got off (80) from the number of children that got on (82).

To determine how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived.
                 First, we need to find the number of trees that survived. Since Haley initially had 3 trees and 13 trees died, the number of trees that survived can be found by subtracting the number of trees that died from the initial number of trees.
                 Number of trees that survived = Initial number of trees - Number of trees that died
                 Number of trees that survived = 3 - 13
                 Number of trees that survived = -10
                 Since the number of trees that survived cannot be negative, it means that all the trees in Haley's backyard died in the typhoon.
                 To find how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived.
                 Difference = Number of trees that died - Number of trees that survived
                 Difference = 13 - (-10)
                 Difference = 13 + 10
                 Difference = 23
                 Therefore, 23 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived

To find the total number of items that Adam's shelves could hold, we need to multiply the number of items that can fit on each shelf by the number of shelves.
                 8 action figures + 10 cabinets = 18 items per shelf
                 18 items per shelf * 4 shelves = 72 items
                 Therefore, Adam's shelves could hold a total of 72 items.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we need to subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died. We know that 9 trees died. To find the number of trees that survived, we need to subtract 9 from the total number of trees Haley grew, which is 14. 14 - 9 = 5. Therefore, 5 trees survived. To find out how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we need to subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died. 9 - 5 = 4. Therefore, 4 more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived. The answer is 4.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many eggs Rebecca has, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in each group. Since each group has 2 eggs and Rebecca wants to split the eggs into groups of 11, we can multiply the number of eggs in each group (2) by the number of groups (11) to find the total number of eggs.
                 Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in each group * Number of groups
                 Total number of eggs = 2 * 11
                 Total number of eggs = 22
                 Therefore, Rebecca has 22 eggs.
                 Alternatively, we can use division to find the total number of eggs.
                 Total number of eggs = Number of eggs in each group / Number of groups
                 Total number of eggs = 2 / 11
                 Total number of eggs = 0.1818 (approximately)
                 Since we can't have a fraction of an egg, we can round up to the nearest whole number to find the total number of eggs.
                 Total number of eggs = 2 * 11
                 Total number of eggs = 22

To find out how many apples He has, we need to first find out how many apples Jackie has. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, we can set up an equation to solve for Jackie's apples. Let's say Jackie has x apples. Then Adam has x + 8 apples. Since together they have 12 apples, we can set up the equation x + (x + 8) = 12. Solving for x, we get 2x + 8 = 12. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2. So Jackie has 2 apples. Since Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, Adam has 2 + 8 = 10 apples. Since He has 9 apples more than Adam and Jackie together, He has 10 + 9 = 19 apples. Therefore, He has 19 apples.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many cookies each of Brenda's family members had, we need to divide the total number of cookies by the number of family members. In this case, the total number of cookies is 22 and the number of family members is 5.
                 22 ÷ 5 = 4.4
                 Since we can't divide cookies into fractions, we can round down to 4 cookies per family member. This is because Brenda's mother can't give a fraction of a cookie to each family member.
                 Therefore, each of Brenda's family members had 4 cookies.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of pencils and crayons Faye has, we need to calculate the total number of pencils and the total number of crayons separately and then add them together.
First, let's calculate the total number of pencils. There are 11 rows with 31 pencils in each row. To find the total number of pencils, we multiply the number of rows by the number of pencils in each row:
11 rows * 31 pencils/row = 341 pencils
Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons. There are 11 rows with 27 crayons in each row. To find the total number of crayons, we multiply the number of rows by the number of crayons in each row:
11 rows * 27 crayons/row = 297 crayons
Now, we add the total number of pencils and the total number of crayons together to find the total number of pencils and crayons Faye has:
341 pencils + 297 crayons = 638
Therefore, Faye has 638 pencils and crayons altogether.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to multiply the number of pencils in each pack by the number of packs she has. Since each pack has 14 pencils and she has 6 packs, the total number of pencils in the packs is 14 * 6 = 84. Then, we need to add the number of pencils in the rows. Since each row has 22 pencils and she has 4 rows, the total number of pencils in the rows is 22 * 4 = 88. To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to add the number of pencils in the packs and the number of pencils in the rows. Therefore, the total number of pencils Faye has is 84 + 88 = 172. The final answer is 172.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to calculate the total amount of money he earns during the 1181 weeks of harvest and then subtract the total amount of rent he pays during the same period.
                 First, let's calculate the total amount of money Lewis earns during the 1181 weeks of harvest:
                 Total earnings = Weekly earnings x Number of weeks
                 Total earnings = $491 x 1181
                 Total earnings = $578,111
                 Next, let's calculate the total amount of rent Lewis pays during the 1181 weeks of harvest:
                 Total rent = Weekly rent x Number of weeks
                 Total rent = $216 x 1181
                 Total rent = $254,016

To find out how many more emails Jack received in the morning than in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of emails he received in the afternoon from the number of emails he received in the morning.
                 Morning emails: 6
                 Afternoon emails: 2
                 6 - 2 = 4
                 Therefore, Jack received 4 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of minutes the machine worked, we first need to find the total number of shirts it made. Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts, and today it made 3 shirts. So, the total number of shirts made is 13 + 3 = 16 shirts. Since the machine can make 8 shirts a minute, we can divide the total number of shirts made (16) by the number of shirts it can make per minute (8) to find the total number of minutes it worked. 16 ÷ 8 = 2 minutes. Therefore, the machine worked for 2 minutes in all.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we need to subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the total weight of their strawberries.
                 Total weight of strawberries = 26 pounds
                 Weight of Marco's strawberries = 10 pounds
                 Weight of his dad's strawberries = Total weight of strawberries - Weight of Marco's strawberries
                 Weight of his dad's strawberries = 26 pounds - 10 pounds
                 Weight of his dad's strawberries = 16 pounds
                 To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we need to subtract the weight of Marco's strawberries from the weight of his dad's strawberries.
                 Difference in weight = Weight of his dad's strawberries - Weight of Marco's strawberries
                 Difference in weight = 16 pounds - 10 pounds
                 Difference in weight = 6 pounds

To find the total number of students who participated in the suggestion of new food items, we need to add the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon to the number of students who did not participate.
                 The number of students who suggested mashed potatoes is 450. The number of students who suggested bacon is 38. To find the number of students who did not participate, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of choices.
                 The total number of choices is 66. Subtracting the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon from the total number of choices, we get 66 - 450 - 38 = -422. Since we cannot have a negative number of students, this means that the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon is greater than the total number of choices.
                 However, the problem states that the rest of the students did not participate. This means that the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and the number of students who suggested bacon cannot be greater than the total number of choices.

To find out how many more hours Ryan spends on learning English than Chinese, we need to subtract the number of hours he spends on Chinese from the number of hours he spends on English.
                 English hours = 6
                 Chinese hours = 3
                 More hours on English = English hours - Chinese hours

To find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we need to subtract the number of roses she threw away from the number of roses she cut. However, we do not know the number of roses she cut. Let's call the number of roses she cut "x". We know that Jessica threw away 33 roses and there are now 17 roses in the vase. We can set up the equation 15 - 33 + x = 17 to represent the situation. Solving for x, we get x = 17 + 33 - 15, which simplifies to x = 35. Therefore, Jessica cut 35 - 33 = 2 more roses than those she threw away. The answer is 2.<|eot_id|>

                 Therefore, 60 - 29 = 31 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.<|eot_id|>

To find the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon, we need to subtract the number of campers who went rowing in the morning from the total number of campers.

To find out how much more a jersey costs than a t-shirt, we need to find the difference between the cost of a jersey and the cost of a t-shirt. We can do this by subtracting the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey.
                 The cost of a jersey is $ 115 and the cost of a t-shirt is $ 25. Subtracting the cost of a t-shirt from the cost of a jersey, we get $ 115 - $ 25 = $ 90.
                 Therefore, a jersey costs $ 90 more than a t-shirt.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money Fred and Jason earned by washing cars, we need to subtract the amount of money they had before from the amount of money they have now.
                 Fred had 111 dollars before and now has 115 dollars, so he earned 115 - 111 = 4 dollars.
                 Jason had 40 dollars before and now has 44 dollars, so he earned 44 - 40 = 4 dollars.

To find the depth of the water, we need to multiply Ron's height by 16 since the depth of the water is 16 times Ron's height. Ron's height is 13 feet, so the depth of the water would be 13 * 16 = 208 feet. Since Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, Dean's height would be 13 + 9 = 22 feet. However, the question only asks for the depth of the water, not Dean's height. Therefore, the depth of the water is 208 feet.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe. Since the recipe calls for 6 cups of sugar and she has already put in 4 cups, she needs 6 - 4 = 2 more cups of sugar. Next, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe. Since the recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and she has already put in 4 cups, she needs 9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the amount of flour she needs. Since she needs 5 more cups of flour and 2 more cups of sugar, she needs 5 - 2 = 3 more cups of flour than cups of sugar. The answer is 3.<|eot_id|>

Since we can't have a negative number of kids, this means that the number of kids who went to camp is greater than the number of kids who stayed home.

                 29 (bottle caps found) - 42 (bottle caps he has now) = -13
                 Since we can't have a negative number of bottle caps, this means that Danny must have lost 13 bottle caps before going to the park.
                 To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to add the number of bottle caps he lost (13) to the number of bottle caps he has now (42).
                 42 (bottle caps he has now) + 13 (bottle caps he lost) = 55
                 Therefore, Danny had 55 bottle caps at first.<|eot_id|>

To find out how much money the Razorback t-shirt shop made from selling the t-shirts, we need to calculate the total amount of money they made from selling 130 t-shirts at the discounted price of $ 43 dollars per t-shirt. We can do this by multiplying the number of t-shirts sold (130) by the discounted price of each t-shirt ($ 43) and then subtracting the total cost of the t-shirts (130 x $ 43) from the total amount of money they received from selling the t-shirts (130 x $ 51).
                 The total amount of money they received from selling the t-shirts is 130 x $ 51 = $ 6630. The total cost of the t-shirts is 130 x $ 43 = $ 5590. Subtracting the total cost of the t-shirts from the total amount of money they received from selling the t-shirts, we get $ 6630 - $ 5590 = $ 1040. Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $ 1040 from selling the t-shirts during the Arkansas and Texas tech game.<|eot_id|>

To determine how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she collected at the ATM and the amount she spent at the supermarket.
First, let's calculate the total amount of money Olivia had after collecting 49 dollars from the ATM. She initially had 3 dollars and collected 49 dollars, so the total amount of money she had is 3 + 49 = 52 dollars.
Next, let's calculate the amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket. We know that she had 49 dollars left after visiting the supermarket, so the amount of money she spent is 52 - 49 = 3 dollars.
Now, let's calculate the difference between the amount she collected at the ATM and the amount she spent at the supermarket. The amount she collected at the ATM is 49 dollars, and the amount she spent at the supermarket is 3 dollars. Therefore, the difference is 49 - 3 = 46 dollars.
So, Olivia collected 46 dollars more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.<|eot_id|>

To determine the number of groups that can be created, we need to identify the item that can be divided into groups of 6. In this case, the eggs can be divided into groups of 6. To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of eggs (18) by 6. 18 ÷ 6 = 3. Therefore, Rebecca can create 3 groups of 6 eggs each. The bananas and marbles cannot be divided into groups of 6, so they will not be included in the groups. The number of groups that can be created is 3.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many pastries the baker would still have, we need to subtract the number of pastries he sold from the total number of pastries he made.
                 Total pastries made = 148
                 Pastries sold = 103
                 Pastries remaining = Total pastries made - Pastries sold
                 Pastries remaining = 148 - 103
                 Pastries remaining = 45

To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to subtract the number of children that got on the bus from the number of children that got off the bus. However, we do not know the number of children that got off the bus. We do know that there were 8 children altogether on the bus after some got on and some got off. We also know that there were 23 children on the bus initially and 24 children got on the bus. To find the number of children that got off the bus, we need to subtract the number of children on the bus after some got on and some got off from the number of children on the bus initially plus the number of children that got on the bus. The number of children on the bus after some got on and some got off is 8. The number of children on the bus initially plus the number of children that got on the bus is 23 + 24 = 47. Subtracting the number of children on the bus after some got on and some got off from the number of children on the bus initially plus the number of children that got on the bus, we get 47 - 8 = 39.

To determine how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we first need to find out how many peaches Jake has. Since Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill, and Jill has 12 peaches, Steven has 12 + 15 = 27 peaches. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 27 - 16 = 11 peaches. To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we subtract Jake's peaches from Jill's peaches: 12 - 11 = 1. Therefore, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.<|eot_id|>

                 23 - 11 = 12
                 Since Matthew gave away 12 crackers in total, and he gave equal numbers of crackers to his 2 friends, we can divide 12 by 2 to find out how many crackers each friend ate.

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we first need to determine the total number of birds. Initially, there were 3 birds. 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them. So, the total number of birds is 3 + 2 = 5. The total number of storks is 6. To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the total number of birds from the total number of storks: 6 - 5 = 1. Therefore, there is 1 more stork than bird sitting on the fence.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the total number of days it took him to finish the book.
                 Total number of chapters = 15
                 Total number of days = 660
                 Chapters per day = Total number of chapters / Total number of days
                 Chapters per day = 15 / 660
                 Chapters per day = 0.0227 (approximately)
                 So, Frank read approximately 0.0227 chapters per day. Since we can't read a fraction of a chapter, we can round this number to the nearest whole number.
                 Chapters per day = 0.0227 ≈ 0.023 (approximately)
                 Therefore, Frank read approximately 0.023 chapters per day. Since we can't read a fraction of a chapter, we can round this number to the nearest whole number.
                 Chapters per day = 0.023 ≈ 0.02 (approximately)

To find the number of kids that go to camp, we need to subtract the number of kids that stay home from the total number of kids.
                 Total number of kids = 313473
                 Number of kids that stay home = 274865
                 Number of kids that go to camp = Total number of kids - Number of kids that stay home
                 Number of kids that go to camp = 313473 - 274865
                 Number of kids that go to camp = 38308
                 Therefore, 38308 kids go to camp during the summer break.<|eot_id|>

To determine how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add, we need to subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount of flour called for in the recipe, and then subtract the amount of flour she has already put in from the total amount of sugar called for in the recipe.
                 The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour and Mary has already put in 4 cups. So, she needs 9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour.
                 The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar and Mary has already put in 0 cups. So, she needs 11 - 0 = 11 more cups of sugar.
                 To find out how many more cups of sugar than cups of flour Mary needs to add, we subtract the amount of flour she needs from the amount of sugar she needs: 11 - 5 = 6.
                 Therefore, Mary needs to add 6 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.<|eot_id|>

To find out how many more files than apps Dave has left on his phone, we need to subtract the number of apps he has left from the number of files he has left.
                 Number of apps left = 6
                 Number of files left = 15
                 Difference = Number of files left - Number of apps left
                 Difference = 15 - 6
                 Difference = 9
                 Therefore, Dave has 9 more files than apps left on his phone.<|eot_id|>

To find the total number of flowers and sticks, we need to multiply the number of pots by the number of flowers in each pot, and then multiply the number of pots by the number of sticks in each pot.
                 The total number of flowers is: 466 pots * 53 flowers/pot = 24,738 flowers
                 The total number of sticks is: 466 pots * 181 sticks/pot = 84,726 sticks
                 The total number of flowers and sticks is: 24,738 flowers + 84,726 sticks = 109,464
                 Therefore, there are 109,464 flowers and sticks in all.<|eot_id|>
