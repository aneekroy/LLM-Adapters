Option1: Natalie Option2: Jennifer Answer format: option1/option2
Jennifer is poor, so she needs to make her clothes.
The correct answer is option2. The sentence should read: "Jennifer is poor, so she needs to make her clothes."

The other option, "Natalie", is not grammatically correct and does not convey the intended meaning.

The correct sentence should read: "Jessica enjoyed a simple, basic life with Betty, but she was bored having a quiet existence." The pronoun "she" is the correct choice because it is the subject of the sentence, and it agrees with the subject "Jessica" in number and gender. The pronoun "he" would be incorrect because it does not agree with the subject "Jessica" in number and gender. The pronoun "it" would also be incorrect because it does not agree with the subject "Jessica" in number and gender. The pronoun "they" would also be incorrect because it is a plural pronoun and does not agree with the subject "Jessica" in number and gender.

Option1: Joel Option2: Eric Answer format: option1/option2
Joel researched laws and helped to open a preschool for Eric. Because he is very good with kids.
The correct answer is option2. The word "he" is the correct pronoun to use in this sentence because it refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Joel. The pronoun "he" is a subject pronoun, which is used to refer to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the subject of the sentence is "Joel", and "he" is the correct pronoun to use to refer to Joel.

Option1: Tanya Option2: Emily Answer format: option1/option2
Tanya told Emily she couldn't come to work because her cat had an infection, but she was lying.
The correct answer is Option2: she was lying. The word "she" is a pronoun that refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Tanya. The pronoun "she" agrees with the subject "Tanya" in number and gender, making the sentence grammatically correct. Option1 is incorrect because "Tanya" is a noun, not a pronoun. A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun in a sentence, whereas a noun is a word that refers to a person, place, thing, or idea. In this case, "Tanya" is the subject of the sentence, and "she" is the pronoun that agrees with it. Therefore, "she" is the correct choice to complete the sentence.
The best answer is Option2.
Note: This question requires the test-taker to understand the difference between a pronoun and a noun, as well as the rules of subject-verb agreement.

Since Donald's understanding of math isn't as good as Joseph's, so option1 is more likely a professor.
The correct answer is: option1. The sentence is saying that since Donald's understanding of math isn't as good as Joseph's, therefore option1 is more likely to be the correct answer. The word "is" is a linking verb that connects the subject (Donald) to the predicate (his understanding of math isn't as good as Joseph's). The word "so" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a subordinate clause that explains the reason why option1 is more likely. The word "more likely" is an adverb that modifies the verb "is" and indicates the degree of likelihood. The word "option1" is the subject of the main clause, and the word "is" is the linking verb that connects the subject to the predicate.

The correct answer is: Patricia made Felicia eggs for an early breakfast, but Felicia does not like fried eggs.

Option1: Angela Option2: Kayla Answer format: option1/option2
It was easy for Angela to become a vegetarian although Kayla couldn't do it. Kayla really missed the taste of chicken.
The correct answer is Option2: Kayla. This is because the sentence states "It was easy for Angela to become a vegetarian", indicating that Angela was the one who became a vegetarian, not Kayla. Therefore, the correct completion of the sentence is "Kayla really missed the taste of chicken". The pronoun "Kayla" is used to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is Angela, not the one who couldn't become a vegetarian.
This type of error is called a pronoun-antecedent agreement error, where the pronoun does not match the subject of the sentence. In this case, the pronoun "Kayla" should be replaced with "Angela" to maintain grammatical correctness.
This type of error can be avoided by making sure that the pronoun agrees with the subject of the sentence in terms of number (singular or plural) and person (first, second, or third person). In this case, the correct sentence should read: "It was easy for Angela to become a vegetarian although Angela really missed the taste of chicken."

Option1: Megan Option2: Jessica Answer format: option1/option2
option2
The best answer is option2. Explanation: The sentence is in the third person (Megan and Jessica are the subjects), so the correct pronoun to use is "she" instead of "they". The sentence should read: "Megan forgot to buy deodorant at the store so she borrowed Jessica's deodorant and hoped she never found out." The use of "she" correctly agrees with the subject "Megan" in the first part of the sentence, and it also correctly agrees with the subject "Jessica" in the second part of the sentence. The use of "they" would be incorrect because it is a plural pronoun that refers to a single person (Megan), and it would also be incorrect in the second part of the sentence because it would imply that Jessica is the one who borrowed the deodorant, which is not the case. Therefore, the correct answer is option2.
Note: This question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of pronouns and subject-verb agreement to complete the sentence correctly. It does not require any specific information from the provided text.

['Brett was browsing the internet while he found the information unlike Randy, he prefers using books.\n\nThe correct answer is option2. The word "he" should be changed to "him" to make the sentence grammatically correct. "He" is a subject pronoun, whereas "him" is an object pronoun. In the sentence, "Brett was browsing the internet while he found the information unlike Randy, he prefers using books", "Brett" is the subject of the sentence and "he" is the subject of the subordinate clause. Therefore, "he" should be replaced with "him" to maintain subject-verb agreement.

The pronoun "she" is the correct choice because it agrees with the subject of the sentence, which is Elena. The pronoun "he" would be used if the subject of the sentence were "he", which is not the case in this sentence. The pronoun "it" is also incorrect because it does not agree with the subject of the sentence.

Option1: Neil Option2: Samuel Answer format: option1/option2
Neil looked all over the neighborhood for their dog until Samuel called and Option1 got their dog back.
The correct answer is: Option2: Samuel
Explanation: The subject of the sentence is "their dog", which refers to the dog that belongs to Neil. The pronoun "their" is a possessive pronoun that indicates that the dog belongs to Neil.

Option1: Brett Option2: Justin Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is: Option1: Brett

Option1: Kevin Option2: Adam Answer format: option1/option2
Option2: Adam.
The completed sentence would be: Kevin ate large amounts of food but not Adam. Adam didn't have to get checked to see if they had a tapeworm. This is because tapeworms are typically associated with eating undercooked or raw meat, which is more likely to be a concern for someone who eats large amounts of food, such as Kevin. Adam, on the other hand, is not described as eating large amounts of food, making it less likely that they would have a tapeworm. Therefore, Adam didn't have to get checked to see if they had a tapeworm.

Option1: bar Option2: gym Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is option2. The sentence should read: "My face was more familiar than it was at the bar than the gym because I went to the gym very rarely." This is because the word "rarely" is an adverb that modifies the verb "went", indicating that the speaker goes to the gym very infrequently. The word "bar" would not make sense in this context, as it would imply that the speaker's face is more familiar at the bar, which doesn't make logical sense. Therefore, option2 is the correct answer.

Option1: Lawrence Option2: Ryan Answer format: option1/option2
The cake that Lawrence tried to bake for Ryan didn't rise, and Ryan felt forgiving about it.
The correct answer is Option2: Ryan. The word "it" in the sentence is a pronoun that refers back to "the cake" in the first part of the sentence, so the correct pronoun to use is "Ryan". This is an example of a pronoun reference, where a pronoun is used to replace a noun in a sentence. In this case, the pronoun "it" is used to refer back to the noun "the cake" in the first part of the sentence, and "Ryan" is used to refer to the subject of the second part of the sentence. This is a common grammatical structure in English, where a pronoun is used to avoid repetition and make the sentence more concise.
This type of pronoun reference is often used in sentences that have a clear subject-verb-object relationship, where the pronoun is used to refer back to the subject of the sentence. In this case, the pronoun "it" is used to refer back to the subject "the cake", and "Ryan" is used to refer to the subject of the second part of the sentence.

The correct answer is Option2: Jennifer. The subject of the sentence is "Natalie", so the pronoun "she" should be used to refer to Natalie. The sentence should read: "Natalie took a longer time to take a bath than Jennifer because she liked relaxing in the tub." The pronoun "she" is the correct choice because it agrees with the subject "Natalie" in number (singular) and gender (feminine). If the sentence were referring to a male subject, the pronoun "he" would be used instead. For example: "Natalie took a longer time to take a bath than Jennifer because he liked relaxing in the tub." In this case, the pronoun "he" agrees with the subject "Natalie" in number (singular) and gender (masculine). The pronoun "she" would not be the correct choice in this case.

The correct answer is Option2: Betty. The sentence should read: "Carrie asked Betty where the children were on the playground because she could not see them."

Option1: dolls Option2: cars Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is Option1: dolls. The sentence should read: "Harold liked to play with dolls more than cars because the dolls talked back to him."

The correct answer is Option2. The sentence should read: "Erin showed Maria to use the fork and knife in a proper manner as she attended etiquette school." The word "she" is the correct pronoun to use in this context, as it refers to the subject of the sentence, which is Maria.

Option1: chocolate Option2: caramel Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is Option2: caramel. The sentence should read: "It took a minute longer to melt the chocolate in the microwave than the caramel, because the caramel was very soft." The word "was" is the correct verb to use in this context, as it is a linking verb that connects the subject "caramel" to the descriptive phrase "was very soft".

Option1: chocolate Option2: caramel Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is Option2: caramel. The sentence should read: "It took a minute longer to melt the chocolate in the microwave than the caramel, because the caramel was very firm." The word "caramel" is an adjective that describes the state of the caramel, indicating that it was hard or firm, which is why it took longer to melt in the microwave. The word "chocolate" is also an adjective that describes the state of the chocolate, but in this context, it is not relevant to the reason why it took longer to melt. Therefore, the correct answer is "caramel".
Note: This type of question requires the test-taker to analyze the sentence and understand the context to determine the correct answer, which is a key aspect of the Identifying Pros And Cons reasoning skill. The test-taker needs to identify the adjective that is relevant to the reason why it took longer to melt the chocolate, which is the state of the caramel, and eliminate the irrelevant adjective, which is the state of the chocolate.

Answer: Option1: bedroom Option2: bathroom
The correct answer is Option1: bedroom. The sentence should read: Matt wanted to change either the plain bathroom or the colorful bedroom, but the bedroom was already colorful. The word "bedroom" is the subject of the sentence, and the verb "was" is in the third person singular form, which agrees with the singular subject "bedroom". Therefore, the correct answer is "bedroom". If the sentence were in the plural form, the verb would be "were", and the correct answer would be "bathrooms". However, in this case, the sentence is in the third person singular, so the verb "was" agrees with the singular subject "bedroom", making "bedroom" the correct answer.
Note: This question requires an understanding of subject-verb agreement, which is a fundamental concept in English grammar. It is essential to choose the correct form of the verb that agrees with the subject of the sentence to ensure grammatical correctness.

Please choose the correct answer to fill in the blank to complete the given sentence: Angela did a bunch of crunches and sit-ups but Cynthia didn't, consequentially _ had six- pack abs.
Option1: Angela Option2: Cynthia Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is: Option2: Cynthia
Explanation: The sentence states that Angela did a bunch of crunches and sit-ups, but Cynthia didn't. The consequence of Cynthia not doing crunches and sit-ups would be that she would not have six-pack abs. Therefore, the correct answer is Cynthia. The word "consequentially" implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Cynthia's actions (not doing crunches and sit-ups) and the outcome (not having six-pack abs). This requires the reader to understand the logical consequence of Cynthia's actions, which is that she would not have six-pack abs.
This question requires the reader to evaluate the consequence of Cynthia's actions, which is a key aspect of Consequence Evaluation. The reader needs to analyze the situation, identify the cause (Cynthia not doing crunches and sit-ups), and determine the logical outcome (not having six-pack abs). This type of question helps to assess the reader's ability to think critically about cause-and-effect relationships and evaluate the consequences of different actions.

Option1: Aaron Option2: Donald Answer format: option1/option2
Aaron showed Donald how to use google play on an android because he owned an apple phone.
The correct answer is Option1: Aaron showed Donald how to use google play on an android because he owned an apple phone. This is because the subject of the sentence is "Aaron", and the pronoun "he" refers to Aaron, who is the subject of the sentence. The pronoun "he" is in the nominative case, which agrees with the subject "Aaron" in number and gender. Therefore, the correct answer is Option1. Option2 is incorrect because "Donald" is the subject of the sentence, and the pronoun "he" refers to Donald, not Aaron. The pronoun "he" is in the nominative case, which agrees with the subject "Donald" in number and gender. Therefore, Option2 is incorrect.
The best answer is Option1.
Note: This question requires the test-taker to analyze the sentence and identify the subject of the sentence, and then apply the rules of pronoun agreement to determine the correct answer.

['Sarah rolls her eyes as Monica extolls the virtues of vinegar as a cleaning solution for everything since she is bored.', 'Nelson always had the best friendships except with Neil since Neil was always so polite.\n\nThe correct answer is Option2: Neil. The word "since" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause that provides additional information about the subject of the sentence. In this case, the dependent clause "since Neil was always so polite" provides additional information about why Nelson did not have the best friendship with Neil.

['option1/option2\n\nThe best answer is option1/option2. Since the sentence states that the backpack has built-in water bottles and places for snacks, it is likely that the speaker forgot to bring the snacks, not the water bottles. Therefore, the correct answer is option1, which is "snacks".

The garbage can smells worse than the recycling, so the recycling is probably a lot more sterile. This is because the recycling bin is designed to be a cleaner and more hygienic place to put recyclable materials, whereas the garbage can is meant to hold waste that is not suitable for recycling. As a result, the garbage can is likely to have a stronger and more unpleasant odor due to the presence of organic waste and other contaminants.

Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the recycling bin is probably a lot more sterile than the garbage can.\nThe best answer is Option2.

['John decided to grow a new breed of plant in his garden but the garden is big. \n\nNote: The correct answer is "garden". The sentence should read: "John decided to grow a new breed of plant in his garden but the garden is big." The word "garden" is the correct answer because it is the subject of the sentence. The word "is" is a linking verb that connects the subject "garden" to the predicate "big". The word "big" is an adjective that modifies the subject "garden". The word "plant" is an object of the verb "grow". The word "he" is a pronoun that refers to the subject "John". The word "his" is a possessive adjective that modifies the noun "garden".

The pronoun "Aaron" is the subject of the sentence, and the verb "went" is in the third person singular form, which agrees with the subject "Aaron". This is an example of subject-verb agreement, a fundamental concept in English grammar. In this case, the subject "Aaron" is a singular noun, and the verb "went" is in the third person singular form, which is the correct form to use when the subject is a singular noun. \n\nThis question requires the test-taker to apply their knowledge of subject-verb agreement to fill in the blank and complete the sentence correctly. It assesses their ability to identify the subject of the sentence and apply the correct form of the verb to agree with it. \n\nThis type of question is relevant to the topic of grammar and sentence structure, and it requires the test-taker to think critically and apply their knowledge of English grammar rules to complete the sentence correctly. \n\nNote: The other option, "Option1: William", is incorrect because the subject of', 'Jessica bought a fancy new pair of shoes. \n\nThe best answer is Option2.

Therefore, the correct completion of the sentence is Option2: Katrina. The word "because" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause that explains the reason for Monica\'s behavior. In this case, the dependent clause "because Katrina stayed up all night" provides the reason why Monica was caught napping in class more often. By choosing Option2, we are indicating that Katrina\'s actions (staying up all night) are the cause of Monica\'s behavior (being caught napping in class more often).

The pronoun "Nick" is the subject of the sentence, and it is the one who struggled with unresolved trauma. The pronoun "Ian" is the one who couldn't understand, so it should be the object of the verb "couldn't understand". Therefore, the correct sentence should use the pronoun "Nick" instead of "Ian".
This type of error is called a pronoun-antecedent agreement error, where the pronoun does not agree with the antecedent (the noun it refers to). In this case, the pronoun "Ian" does not agree with the antecedent "Nick", which is the subject of the sentence. By using the correct pronoun "Nick", the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning.
This type of error can be avoided by making sure that the pronoun agrees with the antecedent in terms of number, person, and gender. In this case, using the correct pronoun "Nick" ensures that the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning.
The best answer is Option1.

Additionally, wood can be easily repaired or replaced if it becomes damaged, whereas a tire would need to be replaced entirely.

The word "Christine" is the object of the sentence, and the pronoun "it" is the object of the verb "was tracked down". Therefore, "she" is the correct pronoun to use in this sentence. The word "Christine" is not the subject of the sentence, so it is not the correct pronoun to use. The word "it" is also not the subject of the sentence, so it is not the correct pronoun to use. The word "Rachel" is the subject of the sentence, so "she" is the correct pronoun to use. The word "Christine" is the object of the sentence, so "she" is the correct pronoun to use.

Option1: Benjamin Option2: Jeffrey Answer format: option1/option2
Benjamin had less piercings than Jeffrey did so it was harder for him to get a number of jobs.
The correct answer is Option1: Benjamin had less piercings than Jeffrey did so it was harder for him to get a number of jobs. The word "a" should be replaced with "a number of" to make the sentence grammatically correct. "A" is an indefinite article, whereas "a number of" is a determiner that is used to indicate a non-count noun. In this context, "a number of" is the correct choice because it refers to a countable noun (number of jobs), whereas "a" would refer to an uncountable noun (a job). This is an example of a subtle difference in word choice that can make a big difference in the meaning of the sentence.
The best answer is Option1.
Note: This question requires the test-taker to understand the difference between indefinite and definite articles, as well as the difference between countable and uncountable nouns. It also requires the test-taker to analyze the context of the sentence and choose the correct word to fill in the blank. This is an example of a higher-level thinking skill, as it requires the test-taker to think critically about

Please choose the correct answer to fill in the blank to complete the given sentence: Starting the engine of the car took less time unlike the truck since the _ 's engine was working at the time.
Option1: car Option2: truck Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is Option1: car. The sentence should read: "Starting the engine of the car took less time unlike the truck since the car's engine was working at the time." This is because the sentence is comparing the time it took to start the engine of the car to the time it took to start the engine of the truck.

Therefore, starting the car's engine would take less time compared to starting the truck's engine.

Option1: Craig Option2: Dennis Answer format: option1/option2

Option1: Craig Option2: Dennis Answer format: option1/option2
Craig had cereal for breakfast while Dennis had a shake, so Dennis finished eating his breakfast.
The correct answer is option2. The subject of the sentence is "Dennis", and the verb "finished" agrees with the subject.

Option1: Monica Option2: Samantha Answer format: option1/option2
Monica can speak English and German but Samantha can only speak English because she was raised in an English-speaking family.
The correct answer is Option2. The sentence should read: "Monica can speak English and German but Samantha can only speak English because she was raised in an English-speaking family." The word "because" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause that explains the reason why Samantha can only speak English.

All of the bands were not able to march on the fields at the same time because the drums were massive.
The correct answer is Option2: fields.

Option1: mineral Option2: tap Answer format: option1/option2
I like to drink mineral water over tap water when I travel outside of the USA because the mineral water is safer than tap water.
The correct answer is Option1: mineral. The sentence should read: "I like to drink mineral water over tap water when I travel outside of the USA because the mineral water is safer than tap water." The word "mineral" is the correct word to use in this context, as mineral water is a type of water that contains minerals and is often preferred for its taste and perceived health benefits.

The best answer is Option2. The correct sentence should read: Rachel hated her new in-laws, but tried to keep it secret from Monica.

Option1: Donald Option2: Ian Answer format: option1/option2
Donald had to wax a lot more frequently than Ian because he had blonde hair.
The correct answer is Option1: Donald. This is because the sentence states "Donald had to wax a lot more frequently than Ian", indicating that Donald is the one who had blonde hair. The pronoun "he" refers to Donald, not Ian. Therefore, the correct completion of the sentence is "Donald had to wax a lot more frequently than Ian because he had blonde hair." The pronoun "he" agrees with the subject of the sentence, which is "Donald", not "Ian". This is an example of subject-verb agreement, where the pronoun "he" agrees with the subject "Donald" in terms of number and gender. In this case, both "Donald" and "he" are masculine, so the pronoun "he" agrees with the subject "Donald". If the sentence were "Ian had to wax a lot more frequently than Donald because he had blonde hair", the correct completion would be "Ian had to wax a lot more frequently than Donald because Ian had blonde hair". In this case, the pronoun "he" would not agree with the subject "Ian", which is feminine, so the correct completion would be "Ian had to wax a lot more

Option1: Christine Option2: Mary Answer format: option1/option2
Option2: Mary
The correct answer is Option2: Mary. The sentence should read: Christine took all the money while Mary told her to save the money for herself. Mary only knows to take. This indicates that Mary is the one who only knows how to take the money, while Christine is the one who took the money. The word "only" is used to emphasize that Mary is the only one who knows how to take the money, and Christine is the one who performed the action of taking the money.
This type of sentence is an example of a relative clause, specifically a subordinate clause, which provides additional information about one of the main clauses in the sentence. In this case, the subordinate clause "Mary only knows to take" provides more information about Mary's ability, and the main clause "Christine took all the money while Mary told her to save the money for herself" provides the main action of the sentence. The word "only" is used to indicate that Mary's ability to take is the only one that is relevant to the situation, and Christine's action of taking the money is the main focus of the sentence.

Option1: Craig Option2: Nick Answer format: option1/option2
Craig grew frustrated trying to coach Nick in soccer, as Nick lacked the aptitude needed for the task. (option1)
The best answer is option1. The subject of the sentence is "Craig" and the verb is "grew". The subject-verb agreement rule states that the verb must agree with the subject in number. In this case, the subject "Craig" is a singular noun, so the verb "grew" is also singular. Therefore, the correct answer is option1. Option2 is incorrect because it uses the plural verb "lacked", which does not agree with the singular subject "Nick".
This question requires the test-taker to apply the subject-verb agreement rule, which is a fundamental concept in English grammar. The test-taker must analyze the sentence and identify the subject and verb, and then apply the subject-verb agreement rule to determine the correct form of the verb.

Option1: Kenneth Option2: Ryan Answer format: option1/option2
Kenneth explained to Ryan that he was dressed like this because he was going to a disco party. Ryan was excited.
The correct answer is Option2: Ryan was excited. This is because the subject of the sentence is "Ryan" and the pronoun "he" is referring to Ryan.

Option1: card Option2: gift Answer format: option1/option2
Option2: gift
The best answer is Option2: gift. The reason is that if the relationship is still in its early stages, it's generally considered more thoughtful and romantic to give a gift, rather than just a card. Giving a gift shows that you're making an effort to make a good impression and show your interest in getting to know her better. This can help set a positive tone for the relationship and make her feel special. While a card is a nice gesture, a gift can be a more personal and meaningful way to express your feelings and intentions. In this case, giving a gift can help avoid the perception that you're being cheap, and instead, show that you're willing to go the extra mile to make a good impression.
Note: The correct answer is based on the assumption that the relationship is still in its early stages, and the speaker wants to make a good impression. If the relationship is already established, the context might be different, and a card might be a more suitable option.

Please choose the correct answer to fill in the blank to complete the given sentence: In order to grow his plants naturally, he bought fertilizer and water. The _ was filled with nutrients.
Option1: fertilizer Option2: water Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is option1. The sentence should read: In order to grow his plants naturally, he bought fertilizer and water. The fertilizer was filled with nutrients. The word "was" is the correct verb to use in this context, as it is the subject of the sentence. The verb "was" is a linking verb that connects the subject "fertilizer" to the rest of the sentence, indicating that the fertilizer is the one that was filled with nutrients. The other option, "water", is a noun and does not fit grammatically or semantically in this context. The sentence would not make sense to say "The water was filled with nutrients", as water is not the one being filled with nutrients, but rather the fertilizer is. Therefore, the correct answer is option1.

Option1: Felicia Option2: Mary Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is Option2: Mary. The sentence should read: "In the hotel laundry room, Felicia burned Mary's shirt while ironing it, so the manager wrote Mary up." The word "up" is an idiomatic expression that means to reprimand or scold someone. In this context, the manager is reprimanding Mary for her carelessness. The other option, "Option1: Felicia", is incorrect because it suggests that Felicia is the one being reprimanded, which is not the case. The correct answer is the person who actually burned the shirt, which is Mary.

Option1: jeans Option2: shirt Answer format: option1/option2
The jeans fit worse than the shirt because I had tried the jeans on at the comparison.
The correct answer is: Option1: jeans
Explanation: The sentence is comparing the fit of the jeans to the fit of the shirt, so the subject of the sentence should be the jeans, not the shirt. Therefore, the correct answer is "jeans". The word "I had tried the jeans on at the store" is a subordinate clause that provides additional information about when the jeans were tried on, but it does not change the subject of the sentence, which is the jeans. The word "on" is a preposition that indicates the location where the jeans were tried on, but it does not change the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is "jeans".

Option1: Hunter Option2: Brett Answer format: option1/option2
The food that Hunter ate was spoiled but not that of Brett because he left his food in the relative position of the fridge.
The correct answer is:
The food that Hunter ate was spoiled but not that of Brett because he left his food in the relative position of the fridge.
Explanation:
The sentence is using the pronoun "he" to refer to the person who left the food in the fridge, which is Brett. The pronoun "he" agrees with the subject of the sentence, which is "Brett". Therefore, the correct answer is "he". The relative pronoun "he" is used to refer to Brett, indicating that he is the one who left the food in the fridge. The phrase "in the relative position of the fridge" is a prepositional phrase that provides more information about the location where the food was left, but it does not affect the choice between "he" and "Brett" as the subject of the sentence. Therefore, the sentence is grammatically correct with "he" as the correct pronoun.
The other options are incorrect because they do not agree with the subject of the sentence. Option 1 is incorrect because "Brett" is the subject of the sentence, not "Hunter". Option

Option1: Brett Option2: Aaron Answer format: option1/option2
Brett took more medicines than Aaron did although Aaron was suffering from many more diseases.
The correct answer is option2. The sentence should read: "Brett took more medicines than Aaron did although Aaron was suffering from many more diseases." This is because "although" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a dependent clause that provides additional information about the main clause. In this case, the dependent clause "although Aaron was suffering from many more diseases" provides more information about Aaron's situation, but it is not the main focus of the sentence. The correct word to use in the blank is "was", which is a linking verb that connects the two clauses together. The other option, "did", is a main verb that would change the meaning of the sentence, making it a different sentence. Therefore, option2 is the correct answer.
This question requires the test-taker to understand the function of subordinating conjunctions and how they are used to connect clauses in a sentence. It also requires the test-taker to analyze the meaning of the sentence and identify the correct word to use in the blank.

The pronoun "they" is used to refer to a group of people, whereas "she" is used to refer to a single person. In this case, the subject of the sentence is Christine, who is a single person, so the pronoun "she" should be used.

Option1: Emily Option2: Samantha Answer format: option1/option2
Emily delivered the daily newspaper to Samantha promptly, so she gave a nice Christmas bonus.
The correct answer is Option2: Samantha. The subject of the sentence is "Samantha", so the pronoun "she" should be used to refer to her.

Option1: Emily Option2: Samantha Answer format: option1/option2
Emily delivered the daily newspaper to Samantha promptly, so she expected a nice Christmas bonus.
The correct answer is Option2: Samantha. The subject of the sentence is "Samantha", so the pronoun "she" should be used to refer to her. The pronoun "he" is typically used to refer to a male subject, while "she" is used to refer to a female subject. In this case, Samantha is a female, so "she" is the correct pronoun to use.
This is an example of a pronoun agreement error, which is a type of grammatical error that occurs when the pronoun used does not match the gender of the subject it is referring to. In this case, using "he" instead of "she" changes the meaning of the sentence and makes it grammatically incorrect.
This type of error can be avoided by paying close attention to the gender of the subject in the sentence and using the correct pronoun to refer to it. In this case, using "she" ensures that the sentence is grammatically correct and accurately reflects the intended meaning.

Option1: Logan Option2: Kyle Answer format: option1/option2
Logan preferred to snowboard while Kyle wanted to do biathlon so Kyle went up the hill.
The correct answer is option2. The sentence should read: Logan preferred to snowboard while Kyle wanted to do biathlon, so Kyle went up the hill. The comma after "biathlon" is necessary to separate the two independent clauses in the sentence. Without the comma, the sentence would be a run-on sentence, which is grammatically incorrect. With the comma, the sentence is a compound sentence with two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction ("so"). The first clause ("Logan preferred to snowboard") is a main clause, and the second clause ("Kyle wanted to do biathlon") is a dependent clause that provides additional information about Kyle's preference. The comma helps to clarify the relationship between the two clauses and makes the sentence easier to read and understand. Therefore, the correct answer is option 2.

Option1: paint Option2: wood Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is Option2: wood. The sentence should read: "Aria tried to fix the fence in his garden by using new paint and wood, but the wood had termites."

Please choose the correct answer to fill in the blank to complete the given sentence: Patricia bought a plant for Natalie to put in her garden, so _ sent a thank you card.
Option1: Patricia Option2: Natalie Answer format: option1/option2
Option1: Patricia sent a thank you card. Option2: Natalie sent a thank you card.
The correct answer is Option2: Natalie sent a thank you card. This is because the subject of the sentence is "Natalie", not "Patricia". The subject of the sentence is the one performing the action of sending the thank you card, which is Natalie. Therefore, Natalie is the one who sent the thank you card, not Patricia.

In this case, the verb "sent" is in the third person singular, which agrees with the singular subject "Natalie". This is a fundamental concept in English grammar, and it is essential to ensure that the verb agrees with the subject of the sentence to maintain grammatical correctness.
This question requires the test-taker to analyze the sentence and identify the subject of the sentence, and then apply the rules of subject-verb agreement to determine the correct form of the verb.

Option1: Patricia Option2: Cynthia Answer format: option1/option2
Cynthia is a famous doctor, blood is normal to them, they get assisted in operations. (option2)
The best answer is option 2. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia", and the pronoun "they" is used to refer to Cynthia. The pronoun "they" is the correct pronoun to use when referring to a person whose gender is not specified or is non-binary. In this case, Cynthia is a female doctor, but the pronoun "they" is used to show respect and inclusivity. Therefore, the correct completion of the sentence is "Cynthia is a famous doctor, blood is normal to them, they get assisted in operations." Option 1 is incorrect because it uses the masculine pronoun "he" to refer to Cynthia, which is not the correct pronoun to use in this context.
This question requires the test-taker to understand the importance of using inclusive language and to recognize the correct pronoun to use when referring to individuals whose gender is not specified or is non-binary.

Please choose the correct answer to fill in the blank to complete the given sentence: Mary used the lotion instead of the cream because her skin was glowing when she used the _ .
Option1: cream Option2: lotion Answer format: option1/option2
The correct answer is: option1. The sentence should read: "Mary used the cream instead of the lotion because her skin was glowing when she used the cream."

Therefore, the correct answer is option1.
This question requires the test-taker to analyze the context of the sentence and choose the word that best fits the description, which is a key aspect of the Identifying Pros And Cons reasoning skill.
